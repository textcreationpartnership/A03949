            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Anet alta mente repo'stum,</hi> The Poets ſpeech, expreſſing the effect of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. So hardly are we giuen by the courſe of nature to forget iniuries and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or to let paſſe diſcurteſies offered. But as the wiſe man ſaith, it is a mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to paſſe by an offence; ſo noble diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, do not ſo much regard the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of their inferiours, as what may beſt fit and beſeeme their eſtate. I muſt needs confeſſe (Right worſhipfull) that I haue greatly offended, by reaſon of my abſence &amp; want of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe towards you for ſo great benefits receiued. But as I found that I was many waies vnworthie and vnable, to ſtand before your honourable father, ſo haue I full proofe of the ſelfe ſame inſufficiency in my ſelfe toward you, euen vnto this preſent day. Thinking it all that I could well performe, (if it were poſſible, to make any requitall or part of amends, for ſuch bountifull liberalitie, as alſo more then common curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie from your ſelfe,) to make my hartie praiers vnto God, for your proſperitie and good eſtate, that you might riſe from credit, to worſhip, and honour, and princely fauour, that you might match, or at leſt wiſe come as neare as might be, to that
<pb facs="tcp:7821:3"/>
high degree, which your noble father poſſeſſed. Yet could I not think that ſufficient, vnleſſe I had in ſome meaſure, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto your worſhip ſome fruit and effect of my ſtudie and labours, vnto the which I was ſo greatly mainteined, by your honourable fathers liberalitie, and furthered alſo, not meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by your fauour and good will, which was and is the more to bee remembred of mee, becauſe it came from you, on my part, vndeſerued, and which is more, vnlooked for.</p>
                  <p>This that I haue preſently dedicated vnto your worſhips view and patronage, part of it, is no other, then that which you haue read before, and ſomewhat more to expreſſe my painfulneſſe and good will, though otherwiſe it be but mean, and not ſo worthie the reading as I could wiſh it. I laboured in the firſt part of the Epiſtle to the Romanes conſiſting on Iuſtification, and was ſo bolde, as to preſent it vnto your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers honor, thinking alſo to haue done my beſt in the ſecond part of the ſame Epiſtle, concerning Gods eternall predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Which at this time by Gods helpe I haue finiſhed, yet ſo, that my ſhoulders were eaſed of the burden. For ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vppon a treatiſe of that matter, written by that famous and learned man, M. <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> (farre more excellent, then I could either deuiſe or frame) glad was I, that my ſtudie and ſearching was ſo well preuented. The places of ſcripture which were added to prooue euery waightie point, were ſo confuſedly ſet downe, that they might haue wearied the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, rather then directed him. Which when I perceiued, I tooke ſome paines though ſmall, to help in that behalfe. And becauſe euerie reader is not of the like vnderſtanding, and that this point of religion ſeemeth hard to conceiue, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to them whoſe wittes be not exerciſed in ſearching ſuch matters) I thought good out of euery chapter, to take out the principall matters, &amp; to ioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their proofes, deſirous to make al as plain &amp; as eaſie as might be poſſible. All which I humbly requeſt your worſhip, to accept in as good part, as it is offered, which ſhall be a mean to encourage me, to labor further, if it like you. And ſo I leaue to trouble you any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He title of this booke (gentle Reader) may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange vnto thee at the firſt bluſh, and ſuch, that if it be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrued, may procure me ſome diſlike or diſcredit. It may be, that I haue followed the example of others, who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues greatly pleaſured, if they can get their betters, maiſters, landlords, to name their children after their names. If this bee the meaning, it may ſomwhat abate that diſlike, diſcredit, and deriſion, which otherwiſe would fall vppon me, in which reſpect I may be vouchſafed of pardon. Or otherwiſe I may bee taken in an other ſence, as to declare my affectionate good will to my honourable patrone deceaſed, as if I had cauſed this to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graued by his tombe, <hi>Hoc monumentum poſuit.</hi> And if it be ſuch that it may not deſerue that credit, as I know it cannot, but wil haue his time to vaniſh, much like the earth or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is frozen, and is anon reſolued; (for a wonder had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the gift to continue long, much leſſe a triſle) yet thus much it may declare, that I was not altogither forgetfull. Or if it be a meane, to encourage others of wealth and account, to be beneficial to poore ſtudents, let the one haue the good report, the other the profit, and let the deriſion redound to my ſelfe. For my part concerning my patron, the right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſir <hi>Thomas Bromley</hi> Knight, Lord Chancellour, and one of her Maieſties moſt honourable priuie Councell in his time, I muſt needs confeſſe, &amp; make it knowne to the world, how the beames of this gracious ſun did ſhine vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. Diet, apparrell, bookes, ſiluer &amp; gold, preferment, countenance, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, good wil, and what euer my heart might deſire; neither
<pb facs="tcp:7821:4"/>
can I ſatisfie my ſelfe, or expreſſe my bounden dutie, by any gradation. And as I was vnworthy of ſo great benefits, ſo the chiefeſt of them came vnto me vnlooked for. Such was the bountifulneſſe of him, whoſe renowne ſhall remaine, ſo long as the deliuerance, from the Scottiſh Queenes conſpiracie is remembred! Oh that poore &amp; painfull ſtudents might meet with ſuch liberall purſes! and with ſuch noble and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bromleion</hi> hearts! <hi>Sat ſit optaſſe, et ſiinueniſſe rarum.</hi> What the poore both ſee and receiue, let them report, to the ſhame of them, that hoord vp their wealth, and conſider not that God hath made them but ſtewards, and hath put it in their hands, if they had hearts to diſpoſe. Eſpecially if they could remember this, which is ſet downe in ſacred writ; <hi>Pro. 19. 17. He that hath pitie vpon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lord, and looke what he laieth out it ſhall be paide him againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as concerning theſe my rude and rurall labours, if I might, I would auoyd diſdaine, or if I may do any good, it is the thing that would reioyce me greatly. This vnlearned worke, ſome will ſay, ſhould haue laine by me a long while, vntill it might haue bin done more perfectly, or elſe it ſhould neuer haue bene put foorth. Other excuſe haue I none, but this, that I could not tell how otherwiſe to ſhewe my dutie, and to giue a proofe of my good will, where I was ſo greatly indebted. It may be taken in good part, if I anſwere you, as one <hi>Iohn Philpot</hi> in the raigne of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, anſwered certaine noble and honourable perſonages, who found themſelues greatly agreeued, that a merchant had got a prize on the enemie. His anſwere was; That he did it not, to take away the praiſe of chiualry from them, but rather that they might be incouraged, to do greater exploits. I haue not put foorth this ſlender exerciſe, to barre any (that are well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, better learned, and right willing to edifie) of their praiſe and due commendation; of the which I confeſſe my ſelfe farre vnworthie, but rather to animate them, that they let not their gifts lie hidden, which being made manifeſt and knowne, might procure the benefit of many. He that cannot
<pb facs="tcp:7821:5"/>
do better, to him this may be ſome helpe, the reſt may take it in good part, and labour to do other good, who do both long for good helpes, and would be glad of that which might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them, to eaſe their painfull ſtudie. They that would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to learning, lightly are thoſe of the poorer ſort, who haue many hinderances.

But becauſe the ſtudie and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the word of God, is the onely meanes, wherby the feare of God is taught, maintained, and increaſed, therfore doth it ſeeme a matter as worthie to be conſidered, and to be perſwaded as the other. And ſo much the rather, becauſe we cannot come ſo perfectly to the fear of God, as by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his word. To the proofe whereof, we haue an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſentence, <hi>Prou.</hi> 2.

                           <hi>the feare of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</hi> All the life of man without the knowledge of the word of God, is but a wilderneſſe, and that is the onely path to bring vs out, all our vnderſtanding is but darkneſſe, and that is the onely lanterne that giueth vs light. Our parents that beget vs, they beget vs after their owne image, and that is ſinfull, ſo that as wée are borne in ſinne, ſo all our<note place="margin">The ſeed of life.</note> delight by nature is in ſinne. Therefore this ſéede and this begetting, may well bee tearmed a mortall ſéede, and a begetting vnto death. But that we may haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent care, and a great delight in the word of God, we are giuen to vnderſtand, that it is the immortall ſéede, the ſéede that begets vs vnto life. As ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, Epiſtle</hi> I. <hi>He hath begotten vs againe, not of mortall, but of immortall ſeede, which hee affirmeth to be the word of God that endureth for euer.</hi> And this is the ſingular commoditie thereof, I. <hi>Iohn. 3. 9. <hi>That hee that is borne of</hi>
                           </hi> God, <hi>ſinneth not,</hi> vnto death, but if he fall, hée riſeth againe by repentance. The reaſon becauſe he ſinneth not, nor delighteth héerein, nor ſuffereth it to raigne within him, is; for that the ſéede of Gods word, ioyned with his feare, remaineth within him, neither can he ſinne, becauſe hée is borne of God, and begotten vnto life, by his holie ſpirite. As they that are in the fleſhe cannot pleaſe God, for the wiſedome of the fleſhe, is enmitie to God; ſo the word of God doth make the power of his ſpirite more effectuall within vs, and teacheth vs how to pleaſe God, and to liue in his fauour. Bleſſed is the man that feareth God, for his great delight is in gods word, and hée maketh more account thereof, then of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny treaſure. For all precious things in the world, they can continue with vs but while we liue in the world, but the ſéede of gods word, as it is euerlaſting, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the ſoule euen when it is departed from the bodie. We are troubled about many things in this life, but as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, there is but one thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that is, the hearing, reading, learning, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on the word of God. And as wiſedome is one of the<note place="margin">VViſedome.</note> greateſt commendations that can be giuen to the feare of god, ſo doth the word of god deſerue the ſelfe ſame commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. <hi>By thy precepts and commandements,</hi> that is by thy word, ſaith the Prophet <hi>Dauid, <hi>I am wiſer then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>
                           </hi> and my elders, <hi>By thy word I haue gotten vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, therefore I hate all wicked wayes. This is your wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> ſaith that holy man <hi>Moſes,</hi> vnto the Iſraelites, <hi>Deu.</hi> 4. <hi>And this is your vnderſtanding in the ſight of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which ſhall ſay, Onely this people is wiſe, and of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and a great nation.</hi> And this was the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that god would ſhould more preuaile with a King, and higheſt gouernour in a realme, then all the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his counſellours. As we ſhall reade in the booke of <hi>Deutro. 17. <hi>And when the King ſhall ſit vppon the thorne of his kingdome, he ſhall reade in this booke all the dayes of his life, and it ſhall bee euer with him.</hi>
                           </hi> To what end and purpoſe? Euen that he may go in and out wiſely, before his people. That being taught and inſtructed by the word of god, he may direct not only his own life in the feare of god, but alſo may gouerne his realme in the ſame feare. That ſo he and his people might be preſerued and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted blameleſſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of god, which is the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the ſoule, and therefore can bee no greater delight. The word of god is the ſéede of grace, which being ſowne in the furrows of Chriſtian harts, increaſeth &amp; multiplieth excéedingly; It is the ſpirituall ſword, that cutteth the fleſh from the ſpirit, which ſeperateth all impure thoughts from the mind, and abandone th all luſtful deſires from the hart; It is the ſacred fire, that burneth away the ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of worldly deſires and worldly vanities; It is the wholſom leauen, that ſeaſoneth &amp; edifieth the ſoule; It is the

ſwéete bread, that féedeth the people of God; It is the true key, that openeth vnto vs Chriſt Ieſus the doore, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to the kingdom of heauen. And when this wiſedom of the word of God; entereth into our hearts, and when this knowledge delighteth our ſoules, then ſhall counſell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vs, and vnderſtanding ſhall kéepe vs. For it doth not only conuert the heart of ſome, vnto the true feare of God,<note place="margin">It conuerteth.

But how? Chiefly by meditating &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the word of God, by ordering the courſe of our liues therafter, and ſetting our whole delight theron. The King as I ſaid before, and chéefeſt in a realme, was commanded to read the word of God all the dayes of his life. An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wherof, we haue in <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> who was appointed of God, to be the Prince and gouernor ouer all the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who by name was thus commanded. <hi>Let not this booke of the lawe depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein, that thou maieſt obſerue and doo according to all that is written</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Proſperitie.</note> 
                           <hi>therein. For then ſhalt thou make thy way proſperous, and then ſhalt thou haue good ſucceſſe.</hi> When we will ſignifie a great pleaſure and delight, we ſay it is a pleaſure and delight for a King, and euerie one woulde wiſh that hée were partaker of Kings delights. Beholde then, which and what is his cheefeſt delight, and let it be of the ſame precious account with thée, as it ought to be with the king. And this delight in reading the word of God, in hearing it preached and expounded vnto vs, the daily muſing and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating thereon, what we haue read and heard, and what hath bene taught vs, this delight doth bring with it, the hatred and deteſtation of ſinne, and ſhall in time bréede in vs, the loue and reuerent feare of God, and at laſt make vs partakers of heauenly ioyes.</p>
                        <p>In conſideration of which effects, that the word of God worketh within vs, the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in his pſalms doth highly extoll it in this ſort. <hi>The word of God is more to be

Yea therin haue I had as great delight, as in all maner of riches, and dearer it hath bene, and is vnto me, then thouſands of gold and ſiluer.</hi> And therefore in the Goſpell it is rightly compared <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. vnto a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hid in the field, which when a man hath found, he hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, and for ioy thereof, departeth and ſelleth all that hée hath and buyeth that field. Alſo vnto a pearle of great price, which when one lighteth vpon, he goeth his way, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all that he hath, to get it. And among men, he that hath a treaſure, his minde for the moſt part, will be vppon his treaſure, and whether he be abroad or at home, where his treaſure is, there will his heart be alſo. So he that hath a pearle of great price, his eye will be ſtil vpon it, alwayes looking and beholding it. It ſhalbe either ſet in a King and Signet, that it may be vpon his finger, or with ſome chaine of gold, or ſome cipres, or the like, it ſhall be hanged about his necke; ſuch ſtore wil he make of it.

The eye is neuer ſatiſfied with reading, and the mind ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth till it be weary, our ſpirits faint before they come to the depth, and when they are neareſt, then are they far off.

                        <p>The Magiſtrates, Iudges, and higheſt Officers, in a realme, although God hath vouchſafed them in his owne title, and called them Gods, yet ſhall they die like men, nay for the moſt part, they liue corrupted men.

afterward fried in torments, and found the dolefull hell, to he his dwelling place for euer.</p>
                        <p>Now what purpoſe is it for vs, to deſire to liue long,<note place="margin">Long life.</note> when there are no true delights, but ſhewes and ſhadowes thereof? When all things in our life are vaine, what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is it to liue, ſéeing that (as it is moſt certaine) the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger we liue, the more ſinfull wée are. This life of ours muſt haue an ende, and peraduenture a fearefull, or an vngodly end, which if we could, but remember and thinke vpon, it would abate and pull backe our reioycing hearts, although all our delight were to liue. How much better were it, to prepare our ſelues againſt the day of death. Séeing that a ſhort life is ſometime a great bleſſing of God, when as the courſe of ſinne ſhall be cut off in vs; And againe, when we are taken away from wofull times to come, and from thoſe miſeries which fall vppon the world. <hi>VViſedome. 4. <hi>Enoch was taken away, leaſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould alter his vnderſtanding. For wickedneſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth and bewitcheth the minde, and the vnſtedfaſtneſſe of concupiſcence, doth ſoone peruert the ſimple heart.</hi>
                           </hi> And becauſe the ſoule of this holy man pleaſed God, therefore haſted he to take him away from wickedneſſe. <hi>Yet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſee vnderſtand it, and conſider no ſuch things in their hearts, how the grace and mercy is vpon his Saints, and his prouidence ouer the elect.</hi> The wicked and vngodly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they liue long in great proſperitie, and ſée not the graue in many yeares, yet is their eſtate accurſed, and they liue long to their greater vengeance and condemnation, vntill the meaſure of their ſinne be filled vp to the brim, and that the iudgement of GOD wayt for them at the doore.</p>
                        <p>Séeing then that theſe delights, which worldly minded men make ſo great account of, come to nothing, and are in themſelues but méere vanities, and as it were ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes without a bodie, and therfore may fitly be compared to <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let vs returne to the true delight and only paradice of the ſoule, I mean the word of God, in<note place="margin">VVord.</note> which paradice, is the trée of the knowledge of good &amp; euil, the trée alſo of life and immortalitie, wherein are perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be found, and ſuch as may well content the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels and bleſſed ſoules. Which is the onely inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wiſedome, the guide of our life, the light in darkneſſe, which ſheweth vs a way to enter into paradice, although Cherubins, and the blade of a ſword ſhaken, be ſet, to kéepe the way of the trée of life; I meane, it ſheweth vs the way into the higheſt heauens, although there be many lets and hinderances to kéepe vs backe. And the way that it onely<note place="margin">Feare.</note> chaulketh out vnto vs is this; The feare of the Lord, and the eſpeciall regard of his wil and commandements, which hath the promiſes and bleſſings of this life, and of that alſo which is to come. By which direction of the feare of God, we reade that the famous Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> was ſafe from the iniuries of ſtraungers; <hi>Lot</hi> deliuered from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring fire, that came downe from heauen, and from thoſe dreadfull iudgements; <hi>Noah</hi> eſcaped the drowning flood, and periſhed not with the vngodly; <hi>Iob</hi> that worthie mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of all ſuccéeding ages, preſerued from the rage &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked intent of the diuel; <hi>Iacob</hi> ſet frée from the murthering hand of his brother <hi>Eſau; Ioſeph</hi> from miſery, exalted to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; <hi>Enoch</hi> taken from the wicked world, and tranſlated into heauen. By which examples and teſtimonies drawne out of the word of God, we ſée the high and great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the feare of God, and that there is no worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to be compared vnto it. In a word, the chiefeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and bleſſings, that the heart of a naturall man can deſire, and the greateſt glory that he can wiſh to riſe vnto, all are included and comprehended within the feare of God.</p>
                        <p>Vnto the which, that I may as I would, exhort you, let vs call to our remembrance, the words that God ſpake vnto his people, by his ſeruant <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying. <hi>O that there

were ſuch a heart in them to ſeare mee, and to keepe all my commandements alwayes, that it might go well with them, and with their children for euer.</hi> O that they were wiſe, then would they vnderſtand this, then would they know that the feare of God doth make a bleſſed life and a happie end. That we may perceiue that the fear of God, doth teach vs to be vpright and iuſt, and to eſchue euill as it did <hi>Iob;</hi> that ſo God may grant our requeſts as he heard and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the praiers of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> that it may come to vs as it did vnto <hi>Iudeth,</hi> that none be able to bring an euill report of vs, becauſe we feare God. Finally, that it may be ſaid of vs, as it was of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> that hée was a man after Gods owne hart, becauſe that with all the power that was in him, he did performe thoſe things which God woulde haue him, and that we may be minded as he was, <hi>I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a doore keeper ſaith he, in the houſe of the Lord, then to dwell in the Pallaces of Princes.</hi>

                        <p>And ſo as people indued with wiſedome, and with an heauenly ſpirit, let vs paſſe by theſe delights of the world, which are rather nullities then nouelties of account, and let vs leaue them to the world and worldly minded men.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, let vs conſider, how the wiſe man doth exhort vs, to the loue and admiration of the feare of God, the delight, wherein is no vanitie, and the happie ioy which alwayes ſhall endure. <hi>Eccle. 40. <hi>To labour ſaith hee, and to be content with that a man hath, is a ſweete life, but hee that findeth a treaſure is aboue them both; Wine and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke reioyce the heart, but the loue of wiſedome is aboue them both; Gold and ſiluer faſten the feete, but counſell is eſteemed aboue them both; Riches and ſtrength lift vp the minde, but the feare of the Lorde is aboue them both; There is no want in the feare of the Lord, and it needeth no helpe.

                     <p>THis booke begins with all is <hi>Vanitie,</hi> and ends, with <hi>Feare God and keepe his Commandements.</hi> If that ſentence were knit to this, which <hi>Saloman</hi> kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth to the end, as the hauen of reſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the turmoyles of Vanitie: it is like that whiche Chriſt ſaide to <hi>Martha; <hi>Thou art troubled about many things, but one thing is neceſſaire.</hi>
                        </hi> That which troubleth vs <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> calles <hi>Vanitie;</hi> That which is neceſſary, he calles <hi>the feare of God:</hi> from that to this, ſhould be euery mans pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage in this worlde; we begin at <hi>Vanitie,</hi> and neuer know perfectly that we are vaine, vntill we repent with <hi>Salomon.</hi> Therefore this is his firſt gréeting and leſſon to all, after his conuerſion, to warne them that all is <hi>Vanitie,</hi> as if God had ſaid to him as he ſaid to <hi>Ezechiel, <hi>Cauſe</hi> Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>to know her abhominations,</hi>

Let cuery man think as I go in this matter, why he ſhuld loue that which <hi>Salomon</hi> repenteth, if he thinke <hi>Salomon</hi> happier after he repented, than he was before.</p>
                     <p>This verſe is the ſumme or contents of all this booke, and therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> begins with it, and ends with it; as if he ſhould ſay. Firſt this is the matter which I wil proue, and after, this is the matter which I haue proued. Now you ſée whether I told you true, that all is Vanitie, I may call it <hi>Salomons</hi> Theame, or the fardle of Vanities, which when he hath bound in a bundle, he bids vs caſt it into the fire: for after he hath done with them, in his laſt Chapter and thirtéenth verſe, as though hee woulde haue no more thought of them, he turnes away from them, as if hée had buried them, and goes to another matter, ſaying; Now let vs heare the end of all, <hi>Feare God, and keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements:</hi> for this is the whole dutie of man. As though hée were excéeding glad, that after ſo many daungers through the rout of Vanities, yet God let him ſée the hauen of reſt, and brought him to the right ende, and ſet him vppon the ſhoare, where he might ſée his vanities, as <hi>Moſes</hi> looked backe vpon his enemies, and ſaw them drowned behinde him.</p>
                     <p>The whole narration doth ſhew, that <hi>Salomon</hi> wrote this booke after his fall. When he had the experience of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and ſéene the folly of the world, what euill comes of pleaſure, and what frute groweth of ſinne; he was bold to ſay, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, &amp;c.</hi> which he auoucheth with ſuch proteſtation, as though he would iuſtifie it againſt many aduerſaries: ſor all the world is in loue with that which he calls vanitie. Therfore he puts too his name in the midſt of his ſentence, as if he wold defend it againſt all commers: if any man aſk, who broched this ſtrange doctrine? the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

a King: So when we are conuerted, we ſhould become Preachers vnto other, and ſhewe ſome frutes of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as <hi>Salomon</hi> left this booke for a monument to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of his conuerſion. Therefore they which write, that <hi>Salomon</hi> died in his ſinne, and that ſuche a famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of God went to the damned, doo great wrong to the worthie King, which giue them ſuch an example to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and would correct their raſh iudgement, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, Firſt, that he was the cleareſt figure of Chriſt (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Melchiſedes</hi>) which paſſed all Kings in his proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and all men in his wiſedome. Secondly, that he was inſpired by the holy Ghoſt lyke the Prophets; to be one of the pennes of God to write his holy word, the word of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which was not fit for a reprobate. Thirdly, that God promiſed to his father, that he would not take his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and his mercy from him, as he did from <hi>Saul,</hi> nor forſake him as he did <hi>Saul;</hi> but correct him in another ſort. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God is ſaid to loue him: therefore, as <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that <hi>Iacob</hi> was elected, becauſe God ſaith, <hi>Iacob haue I loued:</hi> So we may conclude, that <hi>Salomon</hi> was elected, becauſe God ſaith, <hi>Salomon haue I loued.</hi> Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in <hi>Luc.</hi> 13. 28. All the Prophets of God are ſayd to be in heauen: and therfore <hi>Salomon</hi> being an holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, muſt be holden to be in heauen. To ſhewe that he was a holy Prophet, in 2. <hi>Pet. 3. 2. <hi>Peter</hi>
                        </hi> calleth all the Prophets which wrote the ſcripture, <hi>Holy Prophets.</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may gather out of the ſeuenth Chapter of this booke, and the 30. verſe: and out of the 5. of the Prouerbs, and the 14. verſe: that <hi>Salomon</hi> had left his Concubines and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before he wrote this booke. Therefore, to ſay that the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt, the pen of the holy ſcripture, the man whom God loued, the wiſeſt man that euer was, and one of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets, dyed a reprobate; is preſumption againſt the word, impiety againſt God, &amp; wrong to the dead. Although becauſe of his gréeuous fall in Idolatry, and vncleanneſſe, God left him in diſgrace, and makes no mention of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

where he ſpeakes of his death; That they which ſtand, may take héede leaſt they fall, and ſée how eaſie it is to ſlip, by the example of him that was wiſer than they. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> being wicked, and yet ſaued, was a figure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, whoſe ſinnes are forgiuen. Thus hauing found as it were the Mine, now let vs dig for the treaſure. <hi>Vanitie of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp;c.</hi> This is <hi>Salomons</hi> concluſion, when he had gone through the world and tried all things, lyke a ſpie ſent into a ſtraunge country, as if he were now come home from his pilgrimage, they gather about him, to enquire what hée hath heard and ſéene abroad, and what he thinkes of the world, and theſe things which are ſo loued amongſt men; like a man in admiration of that which he had ſéen, and not able to expreſſe particulerly one after another, he contracts his newes into a word: you aſke me what I haue ſéen, and what I haue heard? <hi>Vanitie</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon:</hi> And what elſe? <hi>Vanitie of vanities:</hi> And what elſe? <hi>All is Vanitie.</hi> This is the hiſtorie of my voyage, I haue ſéene nothing but vanitie ouer the world. Carry this for the newes from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Preacher: <hi>Vanitie of vanities, All is Vanitie;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and greater Vanitie, and more than Vanitie: So the further he did go, the more vanitie he did ſée; and the néerer he looked, the greater it ſéemed: till at laſt he could ſée no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanitie.</p>
                     <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was come to this, that he did ſée all things vain, vpon which men ſet their hearts; he was moued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, &amp; could be ſilent no longer, but néeds he muſt write to them which ſéek felicitie (as he did) in tranſitory things, to warne them y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they ſéeke it not any longer in theſe fooliſh things, which haue no ſtability nor contentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but fly from them to the feare of God, which hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſes of this life, and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life to come. Therfore he begins, with <hi>All is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Loue not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, nor y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> things of the world: for I haue tried that there is no certainty in them.</p>
                     <p>Thus he withdraweth them; Firſt, from the wrong way, and then ſets them in the right way to happineſſe,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7821:22"/>
which he defineth at laſt, to feare God, and kéepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. When he had gone through a thouſand Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, then that comes in at the end, euen like our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which ſtaies till death: So his drift is, to ſhewe that mans happineſſe is not in theſe things which we count off, but in thoſe things which we defer: his reaſon is, that they are all vanitie: his proofe is, becauſe there is no ſtabilitie in them, nor contentation of mind: his concluſion is, therfore contemne the world, and looke vp to heauen from whence ye came, and whither ye ſhall go. This is the ſcope which <hi>Salomon</hi> aimes at, as though we did all ſeek happineſſe, but we go a wrong way vnto it: therfore he ſounds a retire, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that if we hold on our courſe, and go forwards as we haue begun, we ſhall not find happineſſe, but great miſery, becauſe we go by vanitie. Therefore to fright vs out of that way, he breakes forth into an exclamation, <hi>Vanitie of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, All is vanitie.</hi> Now <hi>Salomon</hi> full of wiſedome, and ſchooled with experience, is licenſed to giue his ſentence of the whole world. For the ſpiritual man iudgeth all things, his iudgment is ſo certain, that it runs before the euidence, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnes all for vanitie, before he conuince them to be vain; whereas we proue firſt, and condemne after, becauſe our words are no authorities; he concludes firſt, &amp; proue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: neither any iudge did condemne ſo many togither. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> reſolued all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> queſtions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéen <hi>Sheba,</hi> yet <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> neuer anſwered ſo many queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s at once as now; for what can you enquire, but heare you haue an anſwere? Aſke him as the ſouldiers, and harlots, and Publicans, aſked <hi>Iohn,</hi> What is ſin? <hi>Vanitie</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> What is pleaſure? <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> too. What is bewty? <hi>Vanitie</hi> too. What is riches? <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> too. What is honor? <hi>Vanity</hi> too. What is long life? <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> too. This is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtate of all things after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fall, all turned to <hi>Vanitie.</hi> This is no reproch to the things, but a ſhame to him which ſo abuſed them, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> all things ſhould be called <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> for him. What a teſtimony is this of him which ſhould be the onely ſeruant of God on earth, whom he created in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7821:23"/>
righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, whom he framed to his owne Image, whom he placed in Paradice, and would haue rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to heauen, to heare that he hath ſo polluted his life with ſinnes, that now there is nothing but Vanitie. This is a lamentable ſong which will make him wéep that tunes it, if he think what he ſaith, how his ſtate was chaunged ſince <hi>Adam</hi> his father died; Once God ſaid, <hi>That all was good,</hi> and now he ſaith, <hi>That all is naught and vaine,</hi> as though he forbad man, that which he created for man. That is not <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> meaning to debarre men from the vſe of creatures: although all things changed with man, and became worſe then they were; yet he doth here rather ſhewe, that man reapes nothing but Vanitie out of theſe things, by reaſon of his corruption: then that the things themſelues are vain, if they were well vſed. For euen ſince the creation, <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Tim. 4. <hi>That euery creature of God is good,</hi>

If he did not things vainly, nothing ſhould be vaine in the world, wheras now by abuſe, we may ſée ſometime a great vanitie in the beſt things, as in the worſt: For are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vaine in their knowledge, vaine in their pollicies, vain in their learning, as other are vaine in their ignorance? Was not the wiſedome of <hi>Achitophel</hi> a vaine thing? The ſwiftneſſe of <hi>Hazael</hi> a vaine thing? The ſtrength of <hi>Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> a vaine thing?

All agrée vpon the ſame words, but that the laſt is more plaine, and ſaith that all is Vanitie: that is, that man is not onely changed and become vaine: but from the vanitie of man, as the Apoſtle faith: <hi>The creatures are ſubiect to vanitie, and haue not the glory and libertie which they ſhould haue, for the ſin of man.</hi> A ſpirituall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eye doth ſée ſome vanitie or other in euery thing, as appeareth betwixt Chriſt and his diſciples at Ieruſalem.

Therefore, as if he wanted words to expreſſe it, as he did ſée it; he breaks forth into an exclamation, and repeats the ſame often, <hi>Vanitie of vanlties:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I cannot ſpeake how vaine the world is, and very vaine, and nought but vaine: ſpeaking as though he had the féeling ſence of it, as though the world ſtood naked before him, and it gréeued him to ſée, he cuts his words in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Theſe are ſcornfull names to the world, and homely titles to giue our pleaſures, to call them <hi>Vanitie of vanities,</hi> and againe, <hi>Vanitie of vanities,</hi> and yet againe, <hi>Vanitie,</hi> and as though we would prouoke them to fall out with vs, lyke a man that ſharpens his enemy with tauntes, when hée woulde egge him to fight. Hée might haue mollified his tearmes, before he condemned the world thrice, but the world is no chaungling, that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhould chaunge his iudgement, but vaine it is, vaine it was, and vain it wil be, and therefore a thrice vaine worlde he may call it: Firſt, <hi>Vanitie,</hi> ſtraight, <hi>Vanitie of vanities;</hi> and ſuddainely,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7821:25"/>
                        <hi>All is Vanitie.</hi> What a tranſcendent is this? as though it increaſed while he ſpake, ſo faſt groweth this wéed to worſe and worſe, like the Image which appeared to <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> the firſt was of gold, the ſecond of ſiluer, the third of braſſe, the fourth of yron, the fifth of clay; ſo by many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the world growes worſe and worſe, and all they which follow it. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man begins to like of pleaſure, and opens the doore to one vanitie which he loues, ſtraight as many vanities flocke to him, as <hi>Salomon</hi> had Concubines, till the Temple of God be like a den of théeues. Therefore when <hi>Salomon</hi> beheld ſuch a pluralitie, and <hi>Totquot</hi> of Vanities, like ſurges comming one vpon another in pleats and folds; he ſpake as though he would ſhew Vanitie hatching vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; <hi>Vanitie of vanities, All is Vanitie.</hi> The firſt ſaying doth paſſe without let, but the laſt rubbes, and ſincks not into the hearts of men ſo eaſily as it is ſpoken.

What ſay you to Beautie, which is natures dowrie, and cheareth the eye, as ſwéet meate doth the taſt? Beautie is like a faire Picture; take away the cullour, and there is nothing left. Beautie indéed is but a cullour and a temptation: the cull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But what ſay you to Riches, which make men Lords ouer the reſt, and allow them to go braue and lie ſoft, and fare daintily, and haue what they liſt? Riches are like painted grapes, which looke as though they would ſatiſfie a man, but do not ſlake hunger, nor quench his thirſt. Riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed do make a man couet more, and get enuie, and kéepe the minde in care. But what ſay you to Honour, which ſets a man aloft, and makes the knée how, and the tongue ſooth, and the head ſtand bare, as though they were other kind of creatures aboue men?</p>
                     <p>Honour is like a King in a play: when his part is done, his ornaments are taken from him, and he which held the

baſon to him, is as good as he. Honor indéed may command all but life, he makes a faire ſhewe now, but when death comes, all is one.</p>
                     <p>But what ſay you to proſound Knowledge in déepe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, which makes men ſought vnto, and called déepe Clarkes, and great Doctors? Knowledge is like the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which <hi>Vriah</hi> carried againſt himſelfe: ſo Knowledge draweth a greater iudgement, and oftentimes condemnes the bearer.</p>
                     <p>Knowledge without Vertue, leaues a man without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and is a witneſſe againſt him, becauſe he vnderſtands what is good, and will not do it. Yet there is another dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of account behinde: what ſay you to long life, which cauſeth a man to ſée his childrens children, and makes him reuerent vnto the people? Long life is like a long night, when a man cannot ſléepe: ſo Age is weariſome with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſtriues with it ſelfe becauſe it cannot walke, nor talke, nor heare, nor ſée, nor ſléepe, nor taſte, as it was wont, therfore wiſheth often, that night were gone, that the pain were paſt; Indéed he that ſées many dayes, ſees many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and therefore what is not vaine in life, ſith life it ſelfe is vaine? Shew me the light which will not darken, ſhew me the floure which will not fade, ſhew me the frute which will not corrupt, ſhewe me the garment which will not weare, ſhew me the beautie which will not wither, ſhewe me the ſtrength which will not weaken, ſhew me the time which will not paſſe, and I will reclaime that all is Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; yet this will not go for truth, before men haue ſmarted for the triall. Some are ſo vaine, that they count nothing Vanitie, but that which is vainer than the reſt, delights them moſt, for there is as it were, a common-weale of vain perſons, and he that can be vaineſt, is like a King of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt. Some are of this mind, that they thinke all is vaine, but that which they loue, and therfore they call them vaine and curious, and phantaſticall, which ſpeake againſt their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and ſay that it is neceſſary to be vaine, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7821:26"/>
liue, vnleſſe they deceiue; they cannot pleaſe, vnleſſe they flatter; they cannot be beléeued, vnleſſe they ſweare; they cannot be eſtéemed, vnleſſe they royſt; as <hi>Demetrius</hi> thought hée ſhould begge, vnleſſe hée ſhould ſell Images. There is another ſort, lyke the buyer in <hi>Prouer.</hi> 20. which ſaith, It is naught, it is naught, but when he is gone apart, he boaſteth; It is naught before men, and ſweare that all is vanitie, but when they are gone apart, they reconcile themſelues vnto it, and kiſſe it, and promiſe to be vaine ſtill; but they cannot abide to bee counted vaine, the vaineſt man that is. This ſhewes that the folly of the worlde is ſo open and ſhamefull, that her louers muſt néedes condemne her. You ſhall heare them ſay often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, It is a vaine worlde, a wicked worlde, a naughtie world; yet they will not forſake it to dye, lyke daſtarde ſouldiers, who raile againſt the enemy, but dare not fight againſt him. All is Vanitie, but this is Vanitie of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, that men will follow that which they condemne. But this is, that euery ſinner might condemne himſelfe: for the conſcience muſt iudge firſt, and then God as our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>Out of thy owne mouth, and ſo out of thine owne heart, I will condemne thee, naughtie ſeruant;</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the wicked condemne themſelues, before they are condemned of GOD. Theſe are thewords of fooles, which cares not what is their end, ſo that their way be pleaſant.</p>
                     <p>Oh that here were a full end or concluſion of Vanities, but behold, a greater vanitie is behind: for our religion is Vanitie, lyke the Scribes and Phariſies, as <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith in the 23. Chapter, and 27. verſe, hauing a bare ſhew of holineſſe, as he ſaith: he could call it but a ſhewe of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and ſcarce that. Our Vanitie is vanitie, but our holineſſe, is but a ſhewe of holineſſe, not worthie to bee called holineſſe, but lyke holineſſe; yet the moſt part haue not ſo much as the ſhew of holineſſe, as the Phariſics had, but are vaine in ſhewe, inſide and outſide too. Thus wée
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7821:26"/>
finde nothing yet but Vanitie. I cannot leade you from one vnto another, to ſhewe you the ſeuerall vanities of euery perſon, or euery thing, becauſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>All is Vanitie.</hi> How many then haue wée to condemne vs, whoſe vanities are ſprinkeled in euery thing? which haue not onely ſo many vanities as there bee thinges, but many vanities in euerie thing. As in our fare, howe many vanities are there, whiche makes vs riſe ſometimes ſicke, ſometimes ſléepie, ſometimes drunke, yet are there alſo more Vanities; in our ſportes, our laughing, and ſwearing, and ieaſting, and ſcoffing, and dallying, and playing with the Scriptures, which oftentimes leaues ſuch a ſting behind, that we had rather haue loſt our ſport, than feele the worme that gnawes vs for it. And yet there be moe vanities in our apparell, ruffe vpon ruffe, lace vpon lace, cut vpon cut, 24. orders, to the third and fourth degrée, as though our apparell were appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, vntil the woman be not worth ſo much as her attire, that if we could ſée Vanitie her ſelfe, how ſhe would goe, if ſhe did weare apparell, ſhe would goe euen almoſt lyke our women: for ſhe could not goe, nor ſpeake, nor looke vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Who doth not know that theſe are vanities, and that they might leaue them, if they would? But that ye may ſée that there is a heart within, vainer then apparell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Therefore when theſe vanities are worne out, they will haue new, and ſtill new, till all be ſpent vpon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and when they begin lyke the prodigall childe to ſée how vain they were, when they haue bought wiſdom with ſorrow. What would <hi>Salomon</hi> ſay, if he ſhould ſée how va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is growne ſince his time, what a height ſhe is moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what a traine followes her, that there is no Prince in the world hath ſo many attendants as Vanitie? She was but an Impe then, but now ſhée is a mother, and who can number her ſonnes and daughters? The childe is vaine in playing, the mother vaine in dandling, the father vaine in giuing, the Courtier vain in ſpending, the ſouldier
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7821:27"/>
vaine in boaſting, the ſuter vaine in ſtriuing, the traueller vaine in talking, the merchant vaine in ſwearing, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman vain in building, the huſbandman vain in carking, the old man vaine in coueting, the ſeruingman vain in ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the yoong man vaine in ſporting, the papiſt vaine in ſuperſtition, the Proteſtant vaine in conuerſation. Euery vanitie is ſo pleaſant to one or other, that they cannot miſſe one. So ſhe gads by ſea and by land, and ſtill moe diſciples flock vnto her, of gamſters, and ſwearers, and players, and tiplers, and hacſters, and Courtiers, as thick as flies of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> which buzzed in their eares, and their eyes, and their neckes, before and behinde, that a man cannot ſet his foote but vpon vanitie. As the waters couered the earth, when but eight perſons were ſaued: ſo vanitie couered it again, a worſe deluge than the firſt; becauſe it hath not ſuffered eight perſons to eſcape, but euery man is tainted with ſome vanitie or other, which God ſéeing in that place and Citie which ſhould be beſt in the world (that all men in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were vaine) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>alls it the Cittie of Vanitie. So we may call it the world of Vanitie, becauſe ſhe hath an intereſt in euery perſon of it, ſhe ſits vpon the earth like a Serpent, and hatcheth all the ſinnes which ye ſée amongſt men. As full as heauen is of bliſſe, ſo the world is fraught with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, Court, Citie, Country, whither doth not Vanitie go, but to Heauen? Séeing then that Vanitie is extolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, <hi>Salomon</hi> giues his ſentence, that <hi>All is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;</hi> Chriſt like a Mediator concludes vpon it, that there is but one neceſſarie; therefore let our ſentence bee lyke theirs; For ſin, if we had <hi>Salomons</hi> repentance, we ſhould ſée ſuch an image of Vanitie before vs, as would make vs crie againe and againe, as often as <hi>Salomon: <hi>Vanitie of vanities, Vanitie of vanities, and all is Vanitie.</hi>
                        </hi> What a ſwéet ſentence is this from a King, who may liue as they liſt by authoritie; as to ſay, that all is Vanitie. Oh, that we might heare Kings ſpeake ſo againe: for it is a ſpeech which had néed of ſome to countenance it; for none are counted vaine
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7821:27"/>
now, but they that ſpeake againſt vanitie. Then <hi>Salomon</hi> cried it, but now we muſt whiſper it. You may ſée howe times are chaunged: Once this was ſound diuinitie; now it is flat railing: to ſay that all is vanitie, is euen the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of a diſturber. If ye aſke the Atheiſt or the Epicure, rogiſh Players, what is a diſturber? you ſhall ſée that they will make <hi>Salomon</hi> one, becauſe he ſpeaketh againſt vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For this is their definition; he which will not allow men to prophane the Sabaoth, but ſaith, that Cardes, and Dice, and ſtage Players, and May games, and May poles, and May fooles, and Morris-dauncers, are Vanities, is a pratler, a diſturber, and an Archpuritan, by the law which the Iewes had to kill Chriſt. The reaſon is, becauſe men cannot abide to be controlled of their pleaſures. Therefore they hold it as an offence, to ſpeake againſt their ſports, or their cuſtomes, or their follies, or their pleaſures, or their titles, or their toyes; and they which would not be counted preciſe in theſe times, muſt take héede that they goe not ſo farre as <hi>Salomon,</hi> to terme all Vanitie. But they muſt ſay, that the vanities of great men are neceſſary recreations, and the vanities of the people are meanes to make vnitie; Greater bookes are written to maintaine this, then <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> made to refute it, ſo they haue made their wit &amp; their learning vanitie, and are vaine in print. But they that would know now of what ſtanding ſuch preciſe reprouers are, and how auncient this reproofe is, may ſée hére, that if this be a crime to call Vanitie, Vanitie, the wiſeſt man that euer was before Chriſt, was herein crimminate. Not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſtraied, but when he repented, in his beſt minde, when he became like a Preacher, he preached this firſt, <hi>Vanitie of vanities, All is Vanitie:</hi> yet many had rather cry it with <hi>Salomon,</hi> then beléeue it with <hi>Salomon.</hi> And while they are wondring at him, ſome are taken out of the way, and cut ſhort of the time which they ſet to repent: from others, God taketh away his grace, ſo they neuer returne, becauſe their guide is gone.

he ſaith, <hi>They followed Vanitie, and became vaine;</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the thinges we follow, will make vs like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and leade vs whither they belong, to heauen or hell. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20. Vanitie is put for deſtruction, but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer put for ſaluation; If other creatures are ſubiect to a kinde of deſtruction for the ſinne of man, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, what deſtruction ſhall light vpon man for his owne ſinne? Therefore let our ſentence runne with <hi>Salomon, Vanitie of vanities, All is vanitie.</hi> We could affoord the world bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words and fairer titles than Vanitie of Vanities: but call what we wil, <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhews what it is, and what we will ſay in the end when we haue tried it; then Vanitie, of Vanities: yet it is comfort of comforts, glory of glories, life of lifes. But <hi>Laban</hi> ſhewed himſelfe at parting; ſo at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, you ſhall ſée how it will ſerue you, they ſéeme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant vanities, and honeſt vanities, and profitable vanities: but <hi>Dauid</hi> calles them deceitfull vanities; <hi>Ionas</hi> comes after, and calles them lying Vanities; that is, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe pleaſure, and profit, and all, but deceiue all, when they ſhould performe. They play <hi>Laban,</hi> which gaue <hi>Leah</hi> for <hi>Rachel.</hi> If they be lying vanities, and deceiful vanities, then are théy wofull and miſerable vanities; therfore, if we be not come to <hi>Salomons</hi> concluſion, to think that <hi>All is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> it is becauſe our owne vanitie will not ſuffer vs to ſée the vanities of other things. When we haue proued lyke <hi>Salomon,</hi> as faſt as euery man groweth in knowledge, and experience, ſo he begins to cry Vanitie, and after, Vanitie of Vanities, and at laſt, All is Vanitie: ſo we contemne not all at once, but one ſin after another, one pleaſure after another, till at laſt, we count all is vanitie; and then we are come home with <hi>Salomon,</hi> and may be Preachers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other. Thus I haue ſhewen vnto you as it were a limme of Vanitie, you may looke about you and ſée the whole bodie: For if ſhée bee any where in this lande, this is her pontificall Sea, where ſhée is neuer Nonreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Now I will leaue you, to examine theſe ſayings,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7821:28"/>
whether all things haue not bene in vaine vnto you yet, If they haue bene vaine to you, and yet are good in their owne nature, then thinke how vaine you are, who haue turned ſo many good things to vanty. Yet to ſet you in the way before I end, I will anſwere them which aſke, if All things be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; As <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tell vs what we ſhould chooſe, that we be not vaine;</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That one thing is neceſſary.</hi> Is <hi>Salomon</hi> contrary to Chriſt, No? Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> excepts one thing too, <hi>To feare God, and keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> Therefore if all bee vaine but this, let the tempter take thée vp againe, and ſhew thée the kingdomes of the world, when he ſaith, All theſe wil I giue thée, thou maiſt ſay, All this I contemne; for All is vaine.</p>
                     <p>What then? Turne away my eyes (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi>) and my eares, and my heart too from vanitie. Trie and proue thou no longer, for <hi>Salomon</hi> hath proued for thee, it is better to beléeue him, than to trie with him. Therfore it remaineth, that as they brought forth their vaine bookes, after <hi>Paules</hi> preaching, and caſt them into the fire: ſo ye ſhould caſt out all your vanities this day, and ſacrifice them to God, for they haue bene your Idoles, that neuer man may ſée them after. And as God gaue <hi>Iob</hi> other children, ſo they will giue you other treaſures, feare not that your ioyes will goe away with your Vanities, as many thinke they ſhould neuer be merry againe, if they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to Religion. But as <hi>Dauid</hi> daunced before the Arke, as merrely, as <hi>Herodias</hi> daunced before the King: ſo knowe vndoubtedly, that the righteous finde more ioy in goodneſſe, than euer the wicked founde in filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nay (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) more than they can finde in riches and Honours, when their Wheate and Wine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bounde. As a Horſe is a vaine thing to ſaue a man, ſo all theſe thinges are too vaine to make a man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie. I appeale to your ſelues, if ye haue tried the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Vanitie alreadie, (as I know ye haue) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye may readily ſay with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> What profit

Which ſignifieth a great deſire of wiſedome to be ingraffed in vs by nature, and that the praiſe thereof doth paſſe with admiration. For he that ſearcheth after wiſedome and knowledge, deſireth more then gold, if it were as pure, as fine and precious, as that of <hi>Ophir;</hi> the eye may be ſatiſfied with the gliſtering ſhewe of the one, but it can neuer be weary in ſearching af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other; which if indéed it might be ſéene with bodily eyes, would ſtir vp a wonderfull loue and admiration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in our hearts and mindes. To heare a man of wiſedome and grauitie ſpeake, what thronging woulde there bee to heare, what heedfulneſſe and attention to vnderſtand.

it ſhould bee heard with a ſhout greater then that of <hi>Herod,</hi> when the people cried, The voyce of God and not of man. Yea with a farre more reſounding voyce, then that of the Idolaters, mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 19. who in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of their Idole god <hi>Diana,</hi> gaue a ſhout almoſt for the ſpace of two houres, all crying out with one voyce, <hi>Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>
                        </hi> But ſo it is, that although in the firſt age God ſpake to <hi>Abraham, Noah, Moſes,</hi> and other holy men, yet now it hath pleaſed him to take an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe, and that is, that we ſhould heare him ſpeake out of his word. And therefore it was well anſwered vnto the rich man in the Goſpell, that would faine haue his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bren that were aliue, to be taught and inſtructed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the way of God, if not from God himſelfe, yet by an Angel, or at leaſtwiſe, by one that ſhould come vnto them from the dead, that ſo they might amend their liues, I ſay it was well anſwered, They haue <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, they haue the word of God, let them heare them, if they wil not giue care to this word, it is becauſe there is no life in them, if they yéeld not vnto it, they will not be perſwaded though one riſe from the dead againe. We cannot ſay it is farre off, what may it be? Say not in thy heart ſaith the Apoſte, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into heauen, or who ſhall deſcend into the deepe? For the word of God is nearer thee, euen before thy eyes.</hi> Thou néedeſt not to wander a long iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as Quéene <hi>Sheba</hi> did, to heare King <hi>Salomons</hi> wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for thou haſt it at home, and euen within thy owne doores. When Quéene <hi>Sheba</hi> departed as one ſorie that ſhe could not alwayes bee preſent with him, to bee further taught and inſtructed, ſhe pronounced his ſeruants to be happie, that were alwayes about him to heare his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Bleſſed are they</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) <hi>that heare the word of God and keepe it;</hi> and as well it may be ſayd, as <hi>Sheba</hi> did of Salomons ſeruaunts, O howe happie are they, that haue the Word of GOD be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and in their preſence, to reade and ſearch for

wiſedome, farre greater then that of <hi>Salomons;</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a greater then <hi>Salomon</hi> is here. As in the Goſpel, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> that heard Chriſt preach the word, is greatly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aboue her ſiſter <hi>Martha,</hi> that was troubled with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares, and neglected the hearing of Gods word; So doth the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> wonderouſly encourage vs, not onely to the hearing, but alſo to the reading of the word of God, and ſearching the ſcriptures. <hi>Pſal. 119. <hi>Lord</hi>
                        </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what loue haue I vnto thy law, all the day long is my ſtudy in it.</hi>

                     <p>No maruell then if the King were commanded to haue this booke, this word, and the ſcripture of God, and that he ſhould reade therein all the dayes of his life, that he might learne to feare the Lord his God; No maruell if the Quéen of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> chiefe gouernour, <hi>Acts.</hi> 8. had a deſire to read the ſcripture, hauing happily heard the commendation therof; No maruell if the noble men of <hi>Berea,</hi> did diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reade the ſcripture, becauſe they were throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it was the doctrine of life, and the power of ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>And this is one of the waightieſt and moſt profitable ſpéeches that euer our Sauiour vttered. <hi>Search the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for in them ye thinke to haue eternall life; And they are they which teſtifie of mee.</hi> Which ſentence, diuideth it ſelfe into theſe two principall parts, whereof the firſt is a commandement; <hi>Search the Scriptures;</hi> The ſecond, is an effectuall reaſon, to moue vs to the fulfilling of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. <hi>For in them ye thinke to haue eternall life, &amp;c.</hi> In the commandement we may conſider our vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to ſearch; Secondly, the manner how we ſhould ſearch; Thirdly, the great hinderances that keepe vs backe from ſearching.</p>
                     <p>The connſel of a friend is good, but the heart of a man is froward againſt good counſell, ſo that where he loueth dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he wiſheth, that to his counſell, he could adde a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. Therefore the holie ſpirit of God and our redéeming friende, knowing howe ſlowe and howe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7821:31"/>
we are to take good counſell, taketh vppon him to commaund vs to ſo good a worke, as is greatly for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe, as though counſell were not ſufficient, nay ſcarce to commaund would ſerue. For as the fleſh and the world for the moſt part haue the vpper hand, and Gods good ſpirit is welny quenched, ſo heanenly matters are of baſe account, and the deſires of the world preuaile and carry vs whither they would. Forgo all ſaith Chriſt to the young man, and giue to the poore, but he went away ſad and heauy; They that are worldly minded, and are not touched with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>loue of God, cannot loue his word, and if they be willed and ſpoken to neuer ſo much to ſearch the word of God, yet they cannot heare. Wiſedome crieth in the ſtréetes to them that paſſe by, and euery one paſſeth by, and do not regard, becauſe that vanitie is in their eyes, and in their mindes, and in their hearts, ſo that wiſedom can find no place, nor ſuch a ſoule as ſhall bid it welcome, and giue it entertainment. If we had had but half a word, or half a counſell to ſearch after wealth and riches, although it were into far countries, we ſhould refuſe no labour, if to ſéeke for honour and promotion, euery one wold haue thought himſelf worthie to weare a crowne; if to ſéeke for pleaſures, who would not haue followed the lure? Nay who would not preaſe and throng to get in, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the gate were neuer ſo ſtraight? But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it comes to ſearch the ſcriptures, to learne the word of God, euerie one hath this ſhift, I pray thée haue me excuſed. As though the waies of death, were the waies of life, and he that ſhuld counſell vs to ſearch the word of God, were rather our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my then our friend. As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians. Am I therefore become your enemy, becauſe I wiſh you well?</hi> He that reproueth a man, ſhall finde more fauour at the laſt, then he that flattereth with his tongue, and he that ſearcheth the word of God, ſhall finde more comfort at the laſt, then all the delights of the world could affoord him. Many that haue gone aſtray, and liued in the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, when they haue harkened vnto the word
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7821:31"/>
of God, they haue bene ſo altered in minde and purpoſe, that thencefoorth they haue determined with themſelues to take a new courſe, and to liue in the feare of GOD. For the word of God is forcible to beget vs a new life. What age is more licentious, and giuen to naughtie wayes, then youth is? and yet the word of God is of ſuch vertue, that it is able to tame their diſordered humours. Elſe the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> would not haue verified the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pſalme 119. 9. <hi>Wherewithall</hi>
                        </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall a yoong man redreſſe his way? euen by taking heede thereto, according to thy word.</hi> And the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paule</hi> alſo witneſſeth the like effect, in the commendation of <hi>Timothy,</hi> in that he had knowne the holy ſcriptures of a child, which had made him forgoe and forſake the diſordered courſe of vnbride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led youth, and had furthermore made him wiſe vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Well, wée are counſelled and commaunded to ſearch the word of God, yet where there is one to giue vs that counſell, there is a hundreth to drawe vs backe. For as where God hath his Church, the Diuell alſo hath his chappell, ſo as God hath his ſauing the word, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell hath deſtroying bookes inough. Hée workes with the fleſh, and the fleſh ouercommeth the ſpirit, as <hi>Eue</hi> did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> when ſhe brought him to his deſtruction. When the Preacher is at his Sermon, you ſhall ſée ſome fewe to heare, but goe to the ſtage Playes, and you ſhall finde multitudes; If it be an amorous booke, or of paſtime and mirth, euerie one hath it in his hand, but if the word of God be laide before vs, we count it a matter too ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne, and will not vouchſafe to reade it. The wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fleſh is enmitie to God, and the nature of man is giuen to hate that knowledge that leadeth to God. But as for the want of the knowledge of the word of God many periſh, ſo becauſe they refuſe to ſearch it, whereby their euil waies may be redreſſed, and they kept in the feare of God, therefore god giueth them vp to a reprobate ſence to followe wickedneſſe euen with gréedineſſe, and to fall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7821:32"/>
into foule and hainous offences. <hi>Becauſe there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in the land,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>Hoſea 4. 12. <hi>they breake out by ſwearing and lying, and killing, and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and whoring, and bloud toucheth bloud, and one ſinne and miſchiefe commeth after an other.</hi>
                        </hi> What follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch matters our conſciences will giue vs to conſider, and we cannot be ignorant what is like to fall out. If they were wiſe ſaith the Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> they would conſider their latter end, and if the vanitie of folly did not too much raigne within vs, we would ſéeke after wiſedome, and not be ſlow to ſearch the word of God.</p>
                     <p>But let vs leaue them that care not for this knowledge,<note place="margin">The maner how to ſearch</note> and ſo care not for an other life, ſo that they may liue in this world at their pleaſure, let vs leaue them to their fancies, which at length will deceiue them, and to their vanities wherein they are delighted. And as for them who haue any hearts to read the word of God, indéed whoſe hearts God hath touched and moued thereunto, let vs ſearche and ſet downe the beſt way how they may bee directed in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof, that it may tende moſte to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, as holy things muſt not be touched with<note place="margin">VVith reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> vnwaſhen hands according to the prouerbe; ſo muſt we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reading of gods word, with ſanctified minds and circumciſed hearts. When we are to come into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſence of the prince, we prepare our ſelues with all reuerence and humilitie, that our requeſts may be heard, and our deſire granted, and ſo doth the maieſtie of God lye hid in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as though God were there to ſpeak vnto vs, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a double reuerence is to be vſed, that is the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence that may be, when we come to the reading of the ſcriptures. The counſel of <hi>Salomon, <hi>Eccl.</hi>
                        </hi> 4. 17. is this. <hi>Take heed to thy foote, when thou entreſt into the houſe of God;</hi> which alſo giueth vs warning, that we come not vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to the reading of the word of God. For as a foole commeth haſtily without deliberation, and knoweth not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7821:32"/>
that he offendeth, ſo he that commeth without reuerence, committeth folly, although he thinke in comming to the reading of the ſame, he doth full wiſely. <hi>Iacob</hi> in comming to his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> made ſeuen curteſies, &amp; they which will come dutifully to the reading of the word of God, cannot come with too much reuerence. And herein conſiſteth an<note place="margin">VVith deniall of thy owne wiſedome.</note> eſpeciall point of reuerence, to haue that high eſtimation of the word of God, as to thinke there is no wiſedome to be found elſe where, but only therein. For they that ſwel with the thought of their owne wiſedom, and thinke themſelues wiſe inough, although they neuer read the word of God, do greatly diſgrace the maieſtie thereof, and aduance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their owne folly. God graunt ſaith the Prophet <hi>Dauid, <hi>That the wiſedome of</hi> Achitophel <hi>may be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fooliſhneſſe;</hi>
                        </hi> and ſo it fareth with them that ſtand in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of their owne wiſedome, that they are fondly puft vp in their fleſhly minds, and are the farther off from wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge, by how much the more, they thinke themſelues fraught and loaded therwith. <hi>Seeſt thou a foole</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, <hi>there is more hope of him, then of ſuch a one as is wiſe in his owne conceit.</hi>
                        </hi> There is hope of a foole that he may be wiſe, becauſe he wil heare inſtruction, but of him which is wiſe in his own conceit, there is no hope to make him wiſe, becauſe he thinketh he knoweth that, which he ſhould learne. A foole when he holdeth his peace, is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wiſe, for he is lowly in his owne conceit, and doth not preſume of wiſedome, but for the deſire thereof, he will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate himſelfe to ſéeke it, and occupie himſelfe in all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Whereas he that is ſelfe-conceited, ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a foole indéed, in that being voyd of wiſedome, he will not ſearch after it, as if a hungry man ſhould not care for foode, imagining with himſelfe that he is full inough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. What kept the Scribes and Phariſes and other ſuch great Doctors, from the knowledge of the miſteries of God, but the fonde conceit of their owne wiſedome and knowledge. And ſuch were alſo the Athenians, who
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7821:33"/>
thought their learning to be ſo profounde, that they ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the ſimplicitie of the goſpell. But beholde howe they are ouertaken, for god confoundeth the wiſedome of theſe men that are ſo ſelfewiſe, and caſteth away their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. And this is a great puniſhment, that the word of God is vnto them fooliſhneſſe, neither can they perceiue or féele the ſwéet comfort therof, and that through their own default, and through their own pride. To y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blinded Iewes, the word of god is a ſtumbling block, and to the wiſe and learned <hi>Grecians,</hi> it ſéemeth but fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But better it were farre away for them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and forſake their owne fooliſhneſſe, then to drowne in their owne wiſedome. And he that will truly profit in the reading of gods word, muſt laie downe that high conceit, and humbly ſubmit himſelf with al reuerence to be taught, as the ſacred word ſhall inſtruct him. Deny thy own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learning, and ſo ſhalt thou finde both knowledge and wiſedome to ſatiſfie thy ſoule.</p>
                     <p>When thou haſt reſolued with thyſelf, to ſubmit thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note place="margin">Not to reade onely, but to ſearch.</note> to the wiſedom of god, let thy hart cleaue therunto, and let thy mind be ſtill deſirous to read it, as the ſuckling and yoong tender infant crieth for the ſwéete milke, whereby it is nouriſhed and maintained. So the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter. 1. Epiſt.</hi> 22. doth counſell vs, that as new borne babes wée ſhould deſire the ſincere milke of the word of god, that we may grow by it. Euen as the hart deſireth the water brooks, ſo let our ſoules neuer reſt, til we haue quenched our thirſt with this water of Paradice, and ſatiſfied our ſelues with this ſwéete milke and heauenly Manna. A little milke will not content the infant, and a litle foode will not breake hunger, and a little ſtrength will not bee auailable to put backe the force of the enemy. He that will reſiſt the diuels temptations, muſt be throughly armed with the word of god; he that will be a perfect man in Chriſt, muſt growe from ſtrength to ſtrength, from milke to ſtrong meat, from the principles of religion, to the miſteries of ſaluation, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7821:33"/>
he may at length proue, what the good and perfect will of God is. At our firſt enterance to read, we be but as babes, and although we be of great yeares and ripe diſcretion, yet if we deny not our owne wiſedome and become as babes to learne, and to be taught by the word of God, we ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer know the way that leadeth vnto life. And as the infant cannot be throughly ſatiſfied, but ſtill and often calleth, ſo if we thinke to grow from children to men to godward, we muſt often read, and often ſearch his word. Humane know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I meane the knowledge of the Arts and liberal Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, commeth not by meane paines, and the knowledge of God, which he hath reuealed in his word, cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnleſſe we ſearch for it moſt diligently. He that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a veine of gold and ſiluer, diggeth and ſearcheth with labour and ſweate, till he commeth where myne is, and where is plentie; And if we finde any ſwéetneſſe in the word of God, as doubtleſſe they that be diligent ſhall finde great comforts, it is not wiſedome to reſt, vntil we haue fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our ſoules with all heauenly pleaſures.</p>

Still let vs auoyd extremities and kéepe the meane, let vs not be deſirous to know more then God hath ſet downe for vs to know. For many thinke themſelues not wiſe inough, vnleſſe they know all, and wiſer they would be, then either they are, or may, or can be. Hony is ſwéete, but ouermuch annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; it is good to ſearch the word of God, but it is daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſearch too farre. The ſecrets of God, are as the Sun to our eyes, the more we behold it, the more our eyes do dazle, and the more wée ſearch aboue our capacitie, the more our wittes are confounded. They that dig too far in mynes, are ſubiect to the fall of the earth, and alſo to damps that may ariſe, both which, they are to haue as great care vnto, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſiluer or gold which they take ſo great pains for.

He that bringeth vs a glaſſe to looke in, and yet ſhutteth it vp with the couer, he that bringeth vs into the light and yet cloſeth our eyes; he that ſetteth meate before vs and forbiddeth vs to eate, may iuſtly ſéeme to delude vs, and he himſelfe rightly to be accuſed of folly: So the word of God, which is to vs as a gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

in that we doo not vnderſtand them? Suppoſe they come into our Churches and preach vnto vs Gods word, to what end are all their ſpéeches? Among the plagues and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that God threateneth vnto his people for their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, this is not the leaſt, that they ſhould go into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, to ſuch a nation whoſe language they ſhould not vnderſtand. In the lawe it is written, by men of oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that a ſtraunge tongue, which we vnderſtand not, is a ſigne vnto vs of Gods curſe and puniſhment which he laieth on vs. Moreouer we are to vnderſtand, that it is the principall pollicie, and ſecret miſchéeueus working of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap>ll, to hide the Goſpel and word of God from vs, who deſireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then to ſeperate vs from God, who deſireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then our vtter ouerthrow and vndoing. And to bring about this his pollicie and miſchéeuous working, he hath his miniſters euen deceitfull workmen, which thus teach, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God ought not to be read in a knowne tongue vnto the people. Which indéed is the onely way, to kéepe them in Idolatry and ſuperſtition, when they know not the truth of Gods word and pure religion. And while they perſwade the people, that ignorance is the mother of deuotion, that the leſſe they know, the more deuout they are, this is rather a furtherance to their damnation, becauſe they know not God, and the way to ſaluation. For as the extreame want of bodily foode procureth death to the bodie, ſo the extreame want of ſpirituall foode, that is of Gods word, procureth death to the ſoule. It is méet ſay they, that the ſcripture ſhould be ſet downe in an vnknowne tongue, leaſt ſome in reading, peruert them, vnto their owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Which is not a ſufficient reaſon to deny others the reading thereof; as if we ſhould neuer vſe wine, becauſe ſome by abuſing it, haue falne into drunkenneſſe; or neuer take a weapon in hand to defend our ſelues, becauſe many haue bene killed thereby. But this reaſon of theirs, is but a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7821:36"/>
deuice of mans braine, and hath no warrant from Gods word, but is rather contrary vnto it. And herehence alſo ariſeth an other argument of theirs, that becauſe it is ſaid, The prieſts lips ſhould kéep knowledge, therefore it is not for euery one to ſearch the ſcriptures. Indéed it behoueth the Miniſter to be learned, that the people may be reſolued of their doubts by him; yet neuertheleſſe there is no eſtate of people debarred from the reading the ſcriptures. For as God would haue euery man to come to the knowledge of his will, ſo he willeth and commandeth euery one to ſearch the ſcriptures, no eſtate, no calling, excepted. Otherwiſe, if none but the prieſt and miniſter be to reade the ſcriptures, as they are men, ſo vnder the colour and pretence of Gods word, they may put forth their own deuices, and their own imaginations. An other reaſon of theirs is this. Pearls are not to be caſt before ſwine; comparing the word of God, (as it is indéed, a moſt precious treaſure, and as much to vs as our ſoules are worth, becauſe it is the meane to win ſoules) comparing it to a pearle, and the laie people, for whome Chriſt died and ſhead his blood, to procure them ſaluation and euerlaſting life, to compare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſwine. Which ſpéech of theirs, becauſe it is vngodly, vncharitable, and vnchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, I leaue it to the iudgement of others, as not worthie of any anſwere. God forbid that the laie people, although they are vnlearned, if they be ſo godly diſpoſed, and God do moue their hearts therunto, as to ſéeke the comfort of their ſoules, by reading of the ſcriptures, and word of God, God forbid that they ſhould bee debarred from the reading and benefit thereof. But euen as the Eunuch ſpoken of in the Acts of the Apoſtles, being but a laie man, and yet the chief gouernour to a Quéene, although he were vnlearned, did yet for all that reade the ſcriptures, and could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them to the full; ſo may we according to his example, although our capacitie be ſo weake that we cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, giue our ſelues to the reading of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures. For as God ſent vnto him a teacher, Philip by name, into
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7821:36"/>
his charet, vnaware to him, as he was in his iourney, and reading the ſcripture, ſo we know not what helpes it may pleaſe God to grant vs, that are deſirous to read his word, that thereby we may know his will, and be edified and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to our ſoules comfort. And ſéeing we haue that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that many a land hath not, I meane to haue the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in our owne mother tongue, how ſhall we excuſe our ſelues before God, if we bee not diligent and painefull to reade.</p>
                     <p>The other mightie hinderance, whereby we debarre<note place="margin">The ſecond hinderance is, that they ſay the word of God is too hard to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</note> our ſelues from the reading of the word of God, is, that we thinke it is too hard to bee vnderſtood. Like the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, which ſaith a lyon is in the way, becauſe hée is loth to worke. Whither I will not, I cannot goe; and the propertie of an vnwilling ſeruant is, to anſwere his arrant before hée bee ſent. Why ſhould we giue foorth that the ſcripture is hard before wee reade it. Whereas the ſpirite of God doeth ſet it downe, that the word of God doth giue vnderſtanding euen to the ſimpleſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it to a lanterne and to a light, which lightneth euery one that commeth vnto it. For as without the light of the Sunne there is nothing but darkeneſſe on the earth, ſo without the knowledge of the word of GOD, there is nothing but ignorance among men. And this is a wonderfull diſproofe of them, that ſtand in this doubt, thinking it to bee too hard for them being of a ſimple vnderſtanding, and that therefore the Doctors and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men ſhould reade the word, euen this diſproueth their opinion, that heauenly matters are often hid from them that are learned, when contrariwiſe it pleaſeth God to open the eyes of the ſimple, and to giue them vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Elſe how ſhould it be true that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I giue thee thankes ô father, Lord of heauen and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe thinges from the wiſe, and haſt opened them vnto babes, euen ſo ô Lord, becauſe it was thy good will and pleaſure.</hi> If our Goſpell be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7821:37"/>
it is hid to them that are loſt, and if the word of God be hard to be vnderſtood, it is hard vnto the vnwilling and vnto vnbeléeuers, and ſuch as are blinded of their owne accord. Which difficultie and hardneſſe of vnderſtanding, commeth not to paſſe, through the word of God, which is euident and plaine to them whoſe eyes God openeth, and whoſe hearts and mindes it pleaſeth him to enlighten, but through their default, who either through their ſinnes and wickedneſſe, deſerue that Gods word ſhould be hid from them, (for the knowledge of God entereth not into a ſinfull ſoule) or who ſtubburnly refuſe it and will not bee taught thereby; or who are of ſuch a faithleſſe heart, that will not beléeue it, and yéeld themſelues thereunto. Such are not onely blinded through their owne naturall weakneſſe, but moreouer God for a puniſhment vnto them, doth giue them vp to a contrary ſence, to beléeue lies, vanities, vntruthes, and ſuch deceits, that in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they may procure vnto themſelues damnation, becauſe they wold not receiue the loue of the truth, that they might be ſaued.</p>
                     <p>Indéed ſome things there are in the ſcripture, according<note place="margin">Some matters hard.</note> as we reade in the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Pet. cap. 3. v.</hi> 16. that are hard to be vnderſtood. No doubt, to make vs not to thinke lightly of them, or that our wiſedome is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, without the helpe of the ſpirit of God, and alſo to make vs humble in our owne conceit, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earneſtly to craue of God in our daily praiers, that he would make vs partakers of the knowledge of his wil. Many things are hard to be vnderſtood, which they ſaith the Apoſtle that are vnlearned and vnſtable, wreſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, as they do alſo other ſcriptures, vnto their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The faults being remoued wherewith vnſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full readers are ouertaken, there is no cauſe to ſay that the ſcriptures are hard. The vnſkilfull, and the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, reading the ſcriptures, and giuing that interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that their owne ſancie or want of wiſedome doth affoord
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7821:37"/>
them, they may ſoone wreſt and peruert them, and eaſily miſtake. For the wiſedome of man is but fooliſhneſſe in Gods matters. But when we ſettle our ſelues to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">How the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and how to reade them to profit by them.</note> of the ſcriptures, we ought therewithall to frame our ſelues to praier, that it would pleaſe God to lighten our vnderſtanding, that otherwiſe is altogither darke and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh by nature, to open our eyes which are ſhut vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of our own ignorance. And thus reading the ſcripture, with praier for Gods aſſiſtance, that it would pleaſe God to grant vs wiſedom to vnderſtand them, and that we may not be ouerruled by our owne fooliſh fancies; when we read them, with an earneſt deſire to profit by them; then ſhal the ſcriptures be eaſie to vs, which before thought them to be too hard. Again in reading of the ſcriptures we ought not to be ouer raſh, to giue our iudgement out of hand, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in waightie matters, but to compare one ſentence and place of ſcripture with an other, and alwaies to haue an eye that they agrée to the articles of our beliefe. And if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo be ſatiſfied, but that ſtill doubts do ariſe, we ought to haue recourſe to them that haue further knowledge. If there be any ſtrife about landes and poſſeſſions, we craue the ſentence of the Iudge, if any diſeaſe be in the bodie, ſtraightway we ſende for the Phiſitian; So if any doubt or controuerſie doo ariſe in matters of religion, the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miniſter is to aunſwere and reſolue them, by the word of God, and to ſhew them the true meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Many thinges are harde to them that are vnſiable and vnconſtant, ſuch as are readie to bee carried away with euerie winde of vaine doctrine, alwaies wauering, ſometimes in one minde, and ſometimes in an other, to ſuch it is no maruell, if the ſcripture be hard and little for their profite. The nature of man, as it is giuen to heare newes, ſo it is maruellouſly inclined to ſearche out all ſecretes, yet none are more confounded in their owne wiſedome, and none more driuen to vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then they bee. But as for thoſe matters whiche
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7821:38"/>
are for our ſaluation, and for the inſtruction of our liues, they are moſt eaſie to be read, knowne, and vnderſtood, euen of the meaneſt and ſimpleſt, that ſearch thereafter in all humbleneſſe of minde.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond principall matter which I noted vnto<note place="margin">In them ye thinke to haue eternall life.</note> you in this portion of ſcripture, wherehence my text is taken, is the effectuall reaſon, to moue vs to performe the commandement of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Search the ſcriptures.</hi> The commandement is great. <hi>For in them ye thinke to haue eternall life; And they are they that teſtifie of me.</hi> Health is more to be deſired then wealth, and a man will giue all that he hath for his life; yet the life here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, doth farre excéede this life, as farre as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doth the earth, and the way to procure that life, is more eaſie then to preſerue this mortall and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie life. No way ſo eaſie as to ſearch and finde, to read and to be comforted, to vnderſtand wherein true life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, and to enioy it.

He blinded the world, and caſt a miſt of ignorance before their eyes, and kept away the comfortable ſunſhine of the word, hindred the meſſage of glad tidings, and carried away the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt in a cloude, that it might not comfort our hearts &amp; conſciences, that we might not be partakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſed benefits of God toward vs in Chriſt Ieſus.

In the latter times there ſhall be many falſe teachers, ſo that if it were poſſible they ſhould deceiue the verie elect. And this deceit is no meane ſleight, but the indaungering of our ſoules, that we ſhall neuer be partakers of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life. And therefore we are willed to trie the ſpirits, to trie ſuch falſe teachers by the touchſtone of Gods word, and to examine their doctrine, whether it be agréeable to the ſcripture. <hi>Search the ſcriptures, for in them ye ſhall haue life;</hi> that is, ye ſhall be aſſured that ye ſhall not be deceiued in the way of life. Therefore the ſcripture may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the ſtarre, that led the wiſe men vnto Chriſt, ſo that when they came where he was, it ſtood ſtill. Muſicke doth not onely alaie raging and furious mindes, but doth drawe them alſo to a further deſire thereof: ſo the word of God doth not only aſſwage and beate downe the euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of our hearts, but alſo bréedeth in vs a minde to order our ſteppes aright, to liue well, to refraine from the iniuring and oppreſſing of our neighbours, to do good to all, and by little and little it draweth vs, not onely to the loue thereof, but euen with an earneſt purpoſe of mind, we are therby wonne to take that way that leadeth to euerlaſting life. For it mortifieth our ſinfull deſires, by ſhewing vs the<note place="margin">It mortifieth ſinfull deſires.</note> bitter puniſhments that remaine, and that they ſhall neuer enter into the kingdome of God that are led by them. Let not ſinne raigne in your mortall bodies, for the wages of ſin is death, that is the euerlaſting death of bodie &amp; ſoule. Know ye not that the vnrighteous ſhall not inherit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; Be not deceiued, neither fornicators nor ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor buggerers, nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, ſhall inherit the kingdome of God. God is not mocked, for what we ſowe, that ſhall we reape, for he that ſoweth to his fleſh, and followeth his fleſhly deſires, ſhall therehence reape corruption and woe, but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reape life euerlaſting.

the Almightie power of God in the creation of all things; of his infinit wiſdom in diſpoſing them in their due order; of his great goodnes in doing al theſe things for the vſe and benefit of mankinde. Indéed the creation of the world, and all the creatures therein, do bring vs to the knowledge of God, and this is onely the ſcripture of the heathen people, but yet this doth not ſhew vnto vs ſufficiently, how God is our God, and our father in Ieſus Chriſt, which knowledge we do only attain by reading the word of God; And this is the ſcripture of the Chriſtians. Through which knowledge of God in reſpect of Chriſt, we learn that God hath entred into a couenant with all faithful people, that he would be their God, and that they ſhould be his people. And that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to performe vnto god his due ſcruice, which eſpecially conſiſteth in theſe thrée points. Firſt, to worſhip the true God, and to deteſt all idolatry and falſe gods, to make our praiers to God alone, and religiouſly and deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſerue him; Secondly, that the worſhip of God doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſpirituall matters, as faith, hope, charitie, obedience, righteouſnes, holines, innocency, patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, truth, and all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. Thirdly, to improue, accuſe, and condemne all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe and ſinne, infidelitie, deſperation, diſobedience, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, lying, hipocriſie, hatred, ſlaunder, iniurie, and wrongfull dealing; vncleanneſſe, luſt, gluttony, and all other vngodlineſſe and iniquitie. Furthermore, that God doth in mercy and fauour reward the good, and according to his iuſtice puniſh the offendors; and that therefore he hath prepared ioyes and torments after this life. For our ſoules are ſuch that they neuer die, and our bodies ſhall riſe again to be ioyned to our ſoules at the latter day. In reſpect of which knowledge of God, the ſcriptures do perſwade vs ſo to liue in this world, that through our ſin and vngodlines, we loſe not our happie eſtate in the world to come.</p>
                     <p>As touching the knowledge of our ſelues, that is, of our<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelues.</note> excellent eſtate wherein we were created; of our fall, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we loſt and forfaited that eſtate; and howe againe we

Laſtly, in graunting him the rule &amp; gouernment ouer all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The knowledge of our fall, conſiſteth herein, and ſo<note place="margin">His fall.</note> we are taught, that man being created in ſo excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t eſtate, continued not in his innocencie and vprightneſſe, but fell away by his diſobedience from god, and from his excellent eſtate. The cauſes of whoſe fall, were the temptations of the Diuel, the enemy of all mankinde; the enticement of Eue his wife; his infidelitie in not veléeuing gods word to be true, and doubting the puniſhment which god foretold; laſtly his own high mind and wicked wil, by which means he diſobeyed god, and ſo became ſinfull. The ſequele and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his diſobience, ſin and fall were theirs, that thereby he prouoked gods wrath againſt himſelfe, that according to his deſerts he was vexed with infinit miſeries, and that he brought death vppon himſelfe, and vpon all his poſteritie. And ſo through ſin, he chaunged the image of god into the image of the diuel, and cauſed that his ofſpring and poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould be by nature the children of wrath, and ſubiect to miſerie, death, and damnation.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the reſtoring of man, we reade, that gods<note place="margin">His reſtoring.</note> mercy herein, is great and ſingular, who according to his infinit and vnſpeakable goodneſſe, pittying mans miſerie, of his méere grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that the meane whereby man ſhould be reſtored, was, that the ſonne of god ſhould be incarnat, and take our fleſh of a godly woman and pure virgin, being conceiued of the holy ghoſt, and thereby pure and without ſin. Who in our fleſh performed perfect obedience, to make vs acceptable; who by dying in the fleſh
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7821:42"/>
did ſatiſfie Gods wrath, and by death ouercame death, and him that had the power of death, that is the diuell; who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the faithfull children of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſet them frée from the bondage of Sathan; who procured them to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted the ſonnes of God, being by nature the children of wrath; who ſanctified them and inducd them with the gifts and graces of his holy ſpirit, that they might be framed to expreſſe the image of God in their liues and conuerſation, that they might be holy, both in bodie and ſoule, and ſo reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their former eſtate, and become fellowe heires with Chriſt of euerlaſting life, being immortall and bleſſed, and eternally glorified.</p>
                     <p>And thus when in our painfull endeuours, we ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that God hath graunted vnto vs to vnderſtand his will and his word, it will bréed an inward comfort in our hearts and conſciences, which ſhall be a ſufficient witneſſe vnto vs, both of Gods loue and fauour, and of his ſauing and euerlaſting mercies toward vs.</p>
                     <p>God gaue the heathen people a land, wherein were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers<note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> of waters and fountaines, a land of wheate and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and of viniards and figge trées, and pomegranates, a land of oyle and honie, a land wherein was no ſcarcitie, a land whoſe ſtones were iron, and out of whoſe mountaines they dig braſſe, they poſſeſſed great and goodly citties, and houſes full of all manner of goods, they wanted no earthly commodities that their hearts could deſire. All which bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, although they enioyed them to the full, yet in reſpect of the word of God, they were all but as vaine ſhadowes. The great bleſſings of his word and of his lawes, he gaue onely to his owne people. He dealt not ſo, doth the Prophet ſay with the Heathen, nay he dealt not ſo with any nation vnder the Sunne, neither had the Heathen knowledge of his lawes. Which great bleſſing, and the onely treaſure of all treaſures, we enioying through the mercy and fauour of God, ſhall we be found ſo negligent as not to ſearch and ſpend ſome time and ſtudie therein. The time ſhall come

ſaith Chriſt, that ye ſhal deſire one of the daies of the ſonne of man, and ſhall not ſée them. What if God ſhould ſend a famine, not of bread, nor of bodily foode, but of his precious word? What if he ſhould puniſh vs by Idolatry: by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power to a ſtraunge nation to ouerrunne vs. We may wander from ſea to ſea, and from the North euen to the Eaſt, then we may runne too and fro to ſéeke the word of the Lord, and yet not be partakers of our deſires. Now we may reade, let not the opportunitie ſlip vntill the time come that we may wiſh and want. We neuer lightly know what health is, till ſickneſſe come, and then we may be nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to death, then to recouer our health. What was it to <hi>Moſes</hi> that he could ſée that pleaſant land and goodly leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and could not enter into it? And what comfort will it be to vs to thinke that we had time to reade and ſearch the word of God, when we ſhall be debarred from the vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

                        <hi>SImonides</hi> a learned and wiſe Philoſopher, being on a time demanded what God was, gaue not any ſuddaine anſwere, but tooke a pauſe, and ſtood much in doubt what anſwere to make. At laſt, perceiuing with himſelfe, that he was vnable preſently to reſolue the queſtion, deſired a day longer to thinke on the matter; which time being expired, and his anſwer looked for, he deſired two daies more. At the two daies ende, being vnreadie as before, he prolonged to giue his iudgement, and ſtill doubled the time. Wherupon the other maruelling, and deſirous to know the cauſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he refuſed to anſwer; ſéeing he could delaie the time no longer, but that he muſt néeds ſpeake ſomewhat, He burſt forth into theſe words, ſaying. The longer I conſider of it, the more darke your queſtion ſéemeth to be to me, and more intricate. For it laie not in his wiſedome, nor in the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of any man, to comprehend the infinit nature of God. Canſt thou meaſure the earth? or ſounde the depth of the ſea, or perfectly diſcerne how high the heauen is from the earth? If theſe matters be vnpoſſible vnto thée, much leſſe ſhalt thou be able to ſet downe what God is, who filleth the heauen and the earth and all places. Which thing when thou ſetteſt thy ſelfe about to knowe, it is, as if thou were
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7821:45"/>
placed in the midſt of a labyrinth or maze, wherein thou maeiſt goe too and fro, and when thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe almoſt out, then art thou intangled as if there were no end.</p>
                     <p>The longer wee muſe vppon this miſtery to know what God is, the longer we may, and yet neuer the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. So that we may ſay as the Aſtrologians and Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, anſwered King <hi>Nabuchadnezer.</hi> It is a rare thing, and none can declare it vnleſſe it bee God himſelfe, whoſe dwelling is not with fleſh. More ſafe therefore it were, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuerently to think of God his ſacred and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible maieſtie, and not to medle with ſo waightie a matter, but that it hath pleaſed God himſelfe, to vtter the ſame to his ſeruant <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo to all poſteritie. For as God did not ſhewe his maieſtie vnto <hi>Moſes</hi> when he deſired to ſée him, but only his hinder parts, ſo alſo bicauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> had not the capacitie to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue the nature and eſſence of God, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he let him vnderſtand what he was, by his properties and qualities, in theſe words; <hi>The Lord, the Lord, ſtrong, mercifull, and gratious, ſlow to anger, and abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and truth; Reſeruing mercy for thouſands, forgiuing ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and tranſgreſſion, and ſin; and not making the wicked innocent.</hi>

                     <p>This Text, ſtandeth eſpecially vpon theſe two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall points, his iuſtice and his mercy, which are the two notable effects of his nature, and wherunto may be referred all that is ſpoken of him in the ſcriptures. Which here in a fewe words is liuely ſet downe and deſcribed. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which we may conſider in order as they lye, nothing vnto vs theſe fiue thinges. Firſt his ſacred Maieſtie, and the force of his power. Secondly his gentle diſpoſition, inclined ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to mercie. Thirdly, how hée vſeth all meanes to kéepe vs in his feare, and loth that any ſhould offend. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, howe hée offereth and performeth mercy vnto ſinners. Fiftly, his holy and righteous nature, abhoring and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing wickedneſſe. Theſe wordes which I haue reade
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7821:45"/>
vnto you, did God giue forth of himſelfe vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> at the deliuery of his lawe, principally to ſtrike a maieſtie and reuerence into the hearts of the people, that they might haue care to fulfill his lawe, and not to ſet light by it. For although God did ſhewe himſelfe ſo friendly and ſo fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnto his people, yet would hee not haue them too much to preſume. Therefore hée vſeth a maieſtie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue all contempt. For as by nature wée are giuen to diſdaine and to deſpiſe, and are moſt prone vnto contempt, ſo was it moſt requiſite that this meane ſhould be vſed, to reſtraine and bridle our diſordered nature. The experience whereof, we may ſée in children toward their parents. For the familiaritie which parents vſe to their children, doth make them leſſe to be regarded. And if their parents doo commaund them to doo any thing, they will grudge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, whereby they growe to ſuch boldneſſe, that this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie dooth bréede within them an inwarde kinde of contempt. But if in their countenance, ieſture, and all their behauiour, the parentes ſhewe a gouernment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeable to their eſtate, to holde their children in duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſubiection, then will they vſe great reuerence vnto their parents, and ſtande in awe of them, and in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſort will be moſt readie to obey. In like ſort God would not haue his people ſo much to preſume of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure and good will toward them, as though they could vſe the ſame at their will, and being his creatures, they ſhould lift vp themſelues as though they were equall to their Creator. But being their God and their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, therby they ſhould vnderſtande, that his moſte highe ſupremacie was ſo great aboue them, that by righte and authoritie hee mighte commaunde them: To plante in their heartes ſuche a dutifull care as was méete and conuenient. For nothing dooth ſooner abrogate and aboliſh the waightie conſideration of lawes, (which is the bond of ciuilitie and ſocietie among men) then contempt; and againe nothing can more confirme
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7821:46"/>
and eſtabliſh them, then a dutifull care ioyned with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Therefore had God an eſpeciall regard of the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and reuerent account of his lawe, leaſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie thereof, togither with his authoritie, might be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and little ſet by. <hi>Sanctifie the Lorde of hoſtes, and let him be your feare, and let him be your dread,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 8. For loe he that formeth the mountaines, and createth the wind, and declareth to man what is his thought, which maketh the morning darkeneſſe, and walketh vppon the high places of the earth, the Lorde God of hoſtes is his name. And therefore hée may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that with a maieſtie, report himſelfe vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>The Lord, the Lord.</hi> Euen high and terrible, and a great King ouer all the earth, who is greatly to be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the congregation of Princes. For the Lorde is a great God, and a great King aboue all Gods; the Lord hath prepared his throne in heauen, and his kingdome ruleth ouer all. Greatnes, and power, and glorie, and victorie, are his, hée excelleth, and is moſt mightie, he is the Lorde, and his name is moſt glorious, the earth is his footeſtoole, and hee is higher then the Kinges of the earth, who are but his vaſſalles.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7821:46"/>
whom the Lord withdrew from the ſiege and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his people and put a hooke in his noſtrils, and turned him backe the ſame way he came, and cauſed the Angel of his wrath, to ſley a hundreth foure ſcore and fiue thouſand of his ſouldiers. Although <hi>Rabſhakey</hi> his Ambaſſadour, in his be halfe gaue forth theſe words; Heare the words of the great King, the King of <hi>Aſhur;</hi> Thus ſaith the King, Let not your King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> make you truſt in the Lord, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>The Lord will ſurely deliuer vs,</hi> for who are they among all the gods of the nations, that haue deliuered their land out of mine hand, that the Lord ſhould deliuer <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> out of mine hand? But as you heard his ſouldiers were ſlaine, himſelfe was driuen to flight; and furthermore, as he was worſhipping his Idole god <hi>Niſroch, Adramelech,</hi> and <hi>Sharezer,</hi> his own ſonnes, flew him with the ſword and eſcaped; they flew this great King, the King of <hi>Aſhur.</hi> The Lord raigneth, let the people tremble, he ſitteth betwéene the Cherubins, let the earth bee moued. I make a decrée ſaith King <hi>Darius,</hi> that in all the dominion of my kingdom, men tremble and feare before the god of <hi>Daniel;</hi> for he is the liuing god and remaineth for euer, and his kingdome ſhal not periſh, and his dominion ſhall be euerlaſting, King <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> to iuſtiſie the Lord in theſe words, The Lord, the Lord, did extoll and magnifie the King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, praiſed and honoured him that liueth for euer, whoſe power is an euerlaſting power, and his kingdome is from generation to generation. And this did the King confeſſe, after that he had felt the mightie hand of god and his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Let the ſpirit of Princes be ſubiect vnto the Lord, that euen the chiefeſt with the loweſt, may acknowledge this ſoueraigntie, that he is the onely Lord; who is highly to be praiſed and greatly to be feared, for glory and ſtrength are before him. Wherfore giue vnto the Lord ye families of the people, the glory of his name, giue vnto the Lord the power which is due vnto his maieſtie. When the lion roareth, all the beaſts of the foreſt tremble, and when god commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7821:47"/>
who will not obey? If the Captaine that hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer his ſouldiers, may ſay to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he commeth; and to his ſeruant, Do this, and he doth it; Shall not we be as ready when the great Captaine the Lord of hoſtes ſhall charge vs? If the ſeruants ſhall be diligent to fulfill their maiſters will, to how at his beck, and to make haſte when he calleth, ſhal not we yéeld our ſelues to the obedience of our Lord &amp; maiſter, which dwelleth in the heauens, who hath the Angels at commandement, and whoſe creatures we are; who hath more authoritie ouer vs in the wide compaſſe of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, then hath the maiſter ouer his ſeruant within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of his houſe? The ſeruants that are diſobedient, may flie from their maiſters diſpleaſure, and eſcape; but if we be rebellious, we cannot auoid the anger of the Lord. His eies are in all the corners of the earth, neither is there any place wherein we may be frée, if it pleaſe God according to our deſerts to ſtrike vs. Looke what the Prince may do among his ſubiects, much more in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higheſt degrée, may the lord of the whole earth do among vs. Many lawleſſe people may reſiſt that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King commandeth, although it may not be reſiſted by the authoritie of his crowne and dignitie; yea furthermore, may put the king in hazard; but the authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higheſt King is ſuch, that he maketh the ſtouteſt heart to tremble; wel may they murmure &amp; grudge, and ſet them ſelues in defiance againſt him, but they ſhalbe able to do no more, although they were as mightie as the diuels in hell, they ſhal no whit preuaile. A conſuming fire ſhall go before him, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountains ſhalbe al in a ſmoke, the earth ſhal trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at his preſence, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diſobey his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reſiſt his wil, and are as far as they dare at defiance, ſhal in their time hide themſelues in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holes of the rockes, and wiſh y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the mountains might fall vpon them. And then ſhall they know, how y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he onely is the lord, that he hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to command, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they were bound to obey. In di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of the holy ſcriptures, in the prophecies of his

ſeruants and meſſengers, by whom he declared his wil, and whom hee gaue in commandement to deliuer his meſſage vnto the people, when they ſpeake of any matter of waight, they vſe theſe words. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> To put y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people alwaies in remembrance of his high ſoueraigntie and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer them.

Vnto the goates, that is to them that haue diſobeyed him, he ſhal ſay, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the diuel and his angels.</hi> And if god ſpared not the angels, that had ſinned, but caſt them downe into hell, and deliuered them into chaines of darkneſſe, to be kept vnto damnation, and ſpared not the old world, but brought the floud vpon the vngodly, and turned the Citties of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorra,</hi> into aſhes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned them, and ouerthrew them, and made them an enſample vnto them, that after ſhould liue vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Surely the Lord as yet, and from this day vnto the end of the world, will reſerue the wicked and vniuſt vnto the day of iudgement vnto puniſhment.

Hée dooth not puniſh vs according to our deſert, nor reward vs after our iniquities, but ſheweth himſelfe moſt fauourable, that our hearts may relent and ſerue him. Although the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites kept not the couenant of their God, as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 38. 41. and walked not in his lawe, but ſinned againſt him more and more, yet was he ſo mercifull vnto them, that he forgaue them their miſdéeds, and deſtroyed them not, yea many a time turned he his wrath away, and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe. For he conſidered that they were but fleſhe, and that they were euen as a winde that paſſeth away, and commeth not againe. God conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our frailtie and weakeneſſe, is patient toward vs, and ſo tender hearted, that he would haue no man to periſh. And therefore before any puniſhment, that God did vſe againſt his people, he gaue them warning thereof by his prophets, that they might haue iuſt cauſe to ſay, that the Lorde was gracious and mercifull. As we reade in the booke of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, cap.</hi> 9. 30 31. that God did forbeare them many yéeres, and proteſted among them by his ſpirit, euen by the hand of his Prophets, but they would not heare, therefore he gaue them into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of the people of the lands. Which point of Gods mercy, let euery one of vs apply vnto himſelfe, and bethinke our ſelues, how God doth beare with vs from day to day, and what diuerſe and often warnings hee vſeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, to moue vs to returne vnto him.

Wherein all both the beſt and the worſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay otherwiſe, but that the lord is gratious &amp; mercifull

in forbearing. Slow to anger and of great kindneſſe, yet<note place="margin">Correcting.</note> not ſo ſlowe, that hée will neuer ſtrike, or that he will ſuffer his patience to be abuſed, but when he is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouoked, hée putteth his anger in effect. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe as the wicked féele the waight of his anger, ſo towardes his people hée dooth ſo moderate the ſame, that in wrath hée remembreth mercie, and cauſeth his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments to be but remedies to his his owne people, as the Surgion vſeth cutting and launcing, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of him whome hée ſo handleth. The ſcourges and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions<note place="margin">2. <hi>Macc.</hi> 6. 12. 17.</note> that God ſendeth amongſt his people, are not for deſtruction, but for a chaſtening. For it is a token of his great goodneſſe, and of his gratious kindneſſe, not to ſuffer ſinners long to continue, but ſtraightwaies to puniſhe them. For the Lorde dooth not long wayte for vs, as for other Nations, whome hee puniſheth, when they are come to the fulneſſe of their ſinnes; but thus hée dealeth with vs, that our ſinnes ſhould not be heaped vp the full, ſo that afterwards we ſhould be the more gréeuouſly puniſhed. And therefore he neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth his mercie from vs, and though hée puniſh vs, yet dooth hée neuer vtterly forſake vs. So ſlowe hée is to anger, that hée puniſheth them that goe wrong, in a meaſure, warning them, by putting them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of the thinges wherein they haue offended, that they might leaue their wickedneſſe. Furthermore, hée maketh them féele his rodde by a little and little, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them ſpace to repent. If ſaith the wiſe man, thou haſte puniſhed the Egyptians, the enemies of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, (hauing deſerued death) with ſo great conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and requeſting vnto them, giuing them time and place that they might chaunge from their wickedneſſe; with howe great circumſpection wilt thou puniſhe thy owne children. When thou doeſt chaſten vs, thou pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheſt our enemies a thouſand times more, to the intent that when we iudge, we ſhuld diligently conſider thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7821:51"/>
and when we are iudged, we ſhould hope for mercie. We are neuer further off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, then when he doth moſt fauour vs, and he is neuer more truly ſerued, then when he ſtriketh vs with his rod. Theſe effects of Gods anger, and his corrections, may more truly be termed chaſtiſements, then puniſhments; according to that of the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy, cap. 10. 24. <hi>O Lorde correct mee, but with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let thy puniſhment be lenified and moderated with mercy, let it not proceede in thine anger, leaſt I bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and brought to nothing.</hi>
                        </hi> In the <hi>Pſalme</hi> 85. God ſaith by the mouth of his Prophet; <hi>If my children forſake my lawe and walke not in my iudgements, then will I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit their tranſgreſſion with the rodde, and their iniquitie with ſtrokes and ſcourges.</hi> For as ſinne and the breaking of Gods commaundements, is the cauſe of correction, ſo is correction the remedie to bring vs into the way againe. By which forcible mean of Gods fauour, we are ſo humbled and altered, that it procureth amendment in vs. Yea it wrought mightily with the heathen king <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> and brought him to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſhip of God. This forcible meane of Gods fauoure, (I ſay of his fauoure, for otherwiſe where hee dooth correct vs, hee might deſtroy vs) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed ſo with King <hi>Dauid,</hi> that after he felt the ſtroke of his correction, hée deſired that the Lorde woulde inſtruct him in his lawe, and furthermore, that it grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his heart to ſée the wicked tranſgreſſe Gods lawe. Finally, howe great the goodneſſe of the Lorde is in correcting vs, wée may well perceiue by the words of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We are chaſtened of the Lord, becauſe wee ſhould not bee condemned with the worlde.</hi> For thoſe whome GOD loueth, thoſe doeth hee chaſten, as for the wicked and vngodly, hée letteth them runne on ſtill, till they haue filled vp the meaſure of their ſinne, and then in ſteade of correction, whiche mighte conuert them, they ſhall féele the gréeuous and heauie burthen of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7821:52"/>
Gods wrath, vtterly to deſtroy them. Correction bringeth with it time and place to repent, but a ſuddaine deſtruction cutteth off all repentance. For the grace of God, doth often accompany correction, as alwaies his wrath is ioyned with deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>The Lord is merciſull and gratious, ſlow to anger, to bring the wicked to repentance, whom the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. doth greatly reproue for their hardneſſe of heart, and for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing his gratious mercy and long ſuffering. Deſpiſeſt thou ſaith he, the riches of his bountifulneſſe, and patience, and long ſufferance, not knowing that the bountifulneſſe of God leadeth thée to repentance. Againe, he is merciſull and gratious, and ſlow to anger, in reſpect of the godly, becauſe hee dooth not put his anger in full execution againſt them. And that when he ſtriketh them, being moued thereto by his anger, it is for their great good and benefit.</p>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7821:52"/>
diſhonour, yet ſtill was he aboundant in goodneſſe, when you were moſt vnworthie of them. A maiſter will not doo good to that ſeruant, that ſhall diſgrace him, a father will withdrawe his heart from an vnkinde childe. Although a mans iealouſie bee ſuch, that hauing iuſt cauſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his wife for her lewdeneſſe, hée will neuer be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to receiue her; yet is the Lorde aboundant in goodneſſe; <hi>Let my people ſaith hee, put away her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, and I will receiue her againe into fauoure.</hi> The Lordes workes are not as mans workes, and hée is aboundant in kindneſſe, farre contrarie to our nature, who can hardly or neuer incline our hearts to fauoure. This goodneſſe GOD dooth not onelie vſe to the Heathen, to make them lift vp their hearts and mindes from the creatures to the Creator, but in like ſort, alſo hée dealeth with the wicked, to make them chaunge their mindes. Hée ſendeth downe his raine vppon the vniuſt, as well as the iuſt, and for the moſte part, they enioy the goodneſſe of God in a more plentifull meaſure, then doo his owne children. As it is ſaide in the Pſalme, <hi>Whoſe bellies thou filleſt with thy hid treaſure; for they abounde, when other are in ſcarcitie, they feele no want, when other are pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with penurie.</hi> As though Gods benefites were hid from the good, and ſecretly beſtowed vppon the badde, whiche matter hath ſuche ill ſucceſſe, that the wicked are more badde, more proude, more wrongfull, more lewde and vicious, as though they were not onelie Lordes, or rather tyrants ouer Gods flocke, but alſo had the bleſſings of GOD at their owne will and commaundement.</p>
                     <p>Such was the difference betwixt the rich man and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> the one in his roabes, the other in ragges, the one faring delicately, the other not hauing ſo much as a morſell of bread to ſatiſfie his hunger; ſo were the Egyptians Lordes, when the Iſraelites were ſlaues;

the Canaanites dwelling in a lande flowing with milke and hony, abounding in plentie without a ſcarcitie, when the poſteritie of <hi>Abraham</hi> wandred in the wilderneſſe, and endured many extremities. The Viole and the Harpe are in the feaſtes of ſome, and <hi>Iacobs</hi> affliction is not once ſo much as thought on. And who doeth not ſee howe the worſer ſort dooth abuſe the aboundant goodneſſe of God. O that the complaintes and miſeries of the poore, could make their heartes relent, or the wiſhes and prayers of the godly coulde procure a ſufficient redreſſe, or the fearefull endes of their forerunners, could warne them. The Egyptians drowned, the Canaanites deſtroyed, the riche man in hell.

So muche torment for ſo muche pleaſure, waight for waight, and meaſure for meaſure, at leaſtwiſe if it bee not beyonde all meaſure. Yet more properly and more truely it may bee ſaide, that GOD is aboundant in goodneſſe towardes his owne people. As the Prophet Moſes doeth in moſte large ſort ſet it downe. <hi>Deutronomie.</hi> 28.

Bleſſyng them in proſperitie, defending them from their bodily and ghoſtly enemies, prouiding for them in all neceſſities, ſtanding by them, and comforting them in all their miſeries. God was aboundant in goodneſſe towardes his people, and is and will bee vnto the ende of the worlde, but alwaies with an exception, as hee did to the Iſraelites. Vnto all other blſſinges ſaieth the Pſalme, GOD gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the landes of the Heathen, and they tooke the laboures of the people in poſſeſſion. To this end, that they might kéepe his ſtatutes, and obſerue his lawes. But as it fell out amongeſt the Iſraelites, ſo it is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſéene amongſt vs.</p>
                     <p>The Lorde in the Prophecie of <hi>Eſay,</hi> compareth his people to a Vineyard, and his aboundant goodneſſe, to the care hée had ouer that Vineyarde. Hee cauſed his Vineyarde to bee ſeated vppon a verie frutefull hill, he hedged it in, and gathered out the ſtones of it, hee planted it with the beſt plantes, and hée built a tower in the middeſt thereof, and made a Wine preſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Then hee looked that it ſhoulde bringe forth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes. <hi>VVhat coulde I haue done anye more to my Vineyarde, that I haue not done vnto it? VVhy haue I looked that it ſhould bring foorth grapes, and it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth foorth wilde grapes.</hi> Suche alſo hath Gods care euer beene to vs, and for vs, as was that of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7821:54"/>
huſbandman ouer his figge trée, who dreſſed it, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged rounde about it, and dunged it, but when hée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſeeke for frute, I am affraide hée ſhall finde none. But with Gods aboundant goodneſſe, let vs alſo conſider and feare this, leaſt the trée be cut downe. For euerie trée that bringeth not foorth good frute, ſhall bee hewen downe and caſt into the fire. And ſuch iudgement that was pronounced againſt the Iſraelites, ſhall alſo light vppon vs. <hi>I will tell you ſaith the Lord, what I will do to my vineiard, I will take away the hedge thereof, and it ſhall bee eaten vp, I will breake the wall thereof, and it ſhall bee troden downe. And I will laie it waſte; it ſhall not bee cut, nor digged, but briars and thornes ſhall grow vp; I will alſo commaunde the cloudes, that they raine no raine vppon it.</hi> God graunt that euerie one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, may conſider his eſtate, howe good the Lord is vnto him, and bee warned betimes. I beſéeche yée that yée bee not partakers of Gods bountifull goodneſſe in vaine.</p>
                     <p>To Gods aboundant goodneſſe hée putteth a ſeale of<note place="margin">Aboundant in truth.</note> full aſſurance, and that is his promiſe, leaſt that wée ſhould ſtande doubtfull of his goodneſſe. The world is full of promiſes, but they bee nothing elſe but deceit; the diuell can promiſe as faſt, but his promiſes are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes; for hée is the father of lies. The fickle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine mindes of men are readie to promiſe any thing, but for the moſt part there is no more hold in their words, then in the winde. The worlde, the diuell, and men, promiſe mountaines, but the truth is, if they performe any thing, it is but molehilles. So that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neuer to harken vnto their promiſes, then to hope for helpe from them. It is the Lorde onely that kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth faithfull promiſe, who euer liueth, and alwayes helpeth. For GOD is not as man, that he ſhould lye, neither as the ſonne of man, that he ſhould repent &amp; change his minde. Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? And hath
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7821:54"/>
he ſpoken, and ſhall he not accompliſh? Though man doo promiſe, yet is he alwaies wauering, and more likely to chaunge his purpoſe, then to continue conſtant. But this is one of the vnchaungeable properties of god, as to be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in his promiſes. According to that of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames 1. 17. <hi>Euerie good giuing, and euerie perfect gift, is from aboue, and commeth downe from the father of lights, with whome is no variableneſſe, neither ſhadowing by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                        </hi> All his promiſes are yea, and Amen, that is to ſay, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truthes. For as he is aboundant in goodnes, ſo alſo is he aboundant in truth. God is alwaies mindful of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, although it bee to a thouſande generations. As the Pſalme doth teſtifie concerning the Iſraelites, <hi>That God remembred his holy promiſe, and Abraham his ſeruant.</hi> For as he promiſed that his ſéed ſhuld increaſe into multitudes, ſo alſo was it his promiſe, that they ſhuld poſſeſſe the gates of their enemies. For although they were a long time euil intreated, and held vnder cruell ſlauery and bondage, yet God for his promiſe and mercy ſake, at length did ſet them frée: And brought them into a good and plentifull land, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with milke and honie, and abounding with all Gods bleſſings, but ſo, that it pleaſed God to trie them by many extremities. Wherein our fraile nature is too weake, for if god do not performe when we looke for it, wée are readie ſtraightway to ſay, Is the promiſe of the Lord come to an end, and hath he forgot to be good and gratious? Should we receiue good at the Lords hand, and not euill ſaith <hi>Iob?</hi> And is it not for vs to wait and ſtaie the Lords leiſure? And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many fall away for want of preſent performance, yet let not vs doubt the goodneſſe of God, which is a ſure ſtaie in the time of néed, if we be ſtedfaſt in hope, and not too impatient in trouble. And why ſhould not we wait for the goodneſſe of god, although our miſeries be great. Behold the huſbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, vntill he receiue the former and the latter raine. If God for diuers neceſſary conſiderations,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7821:55"/>
regarding that which is moſt for his glory and our good, do withdraw his helpe in this world, yet he requites it in an other world, graunting vs a better matter then we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of him. And ſo it falleth out, that when we thinke his promiſe doth vs leaſt good, then doth it turne to our beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage and greateſt comfort, requiting earthly miſeries with heauenly ioyes. So excéeding good is he vnto vs, by vſing all meanes to kéepe vs in his feare, and ſo doth hée helpe and ſtaie vs, leſt we ſhould fall away from him.</p>
                     <p>Yet fraile fleſh is readie to fall away euery houre, and<note place="margin">4</note> doth often fall away for all gods goodnes, neuertheleſſe the<note place="margin">Reſeruing mercy, &amp;c.</note> mercy of the Lord is ſuch, that he lifteth vs vp againe.

The day of his wrath &amp; laſt iudgement, is but one day, but he delaieth that day many a thouſand daies &amp; yéeres, becauſe he would<note place="margin">Offering mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> haue no man periſh, but all to come to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance.

Euery where in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures doth God ſhew forth his mercy by his ſeruants the Prophets, warning his people early &amp; late, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon. Yet as the raine that falleth vpon the barren ground hath no effect, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercy of God being offered, doth not alwaies enter into our hearts.

Surely as he is mercifull to his ſeruants, ſo his reuenging hand is vpon the vngodly. For on them he will raine ſuares, fire and brimſtone, as ſaith the Pſalme.

of all ſinners and offenders, giuing them to vnderſtand, what they are to look for, if neither his mercy nor his threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings will preuaile. It ſéemes that the wicked are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, becauſe God doth not puniſh them, and becauſe in a maner they do what they liſt without controulment. So they runne their courſe, and God doth ſuffer them, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are innocent, but becauſe their vengeance may be the heauier. It is with them as it was with <hi>Shimei,</hi> who curſed <hi>Dauid,</hi> concerning whom, he gaue a charge vnto his ſonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſaying. <hi>Behold <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed me with a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible curſe, but afterward he came vnto me, and I ſware vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that I would not ſlay him with the ſword. But thou ſhalt not count him innocent. For thou art a wiſe man, and knoweſt what thou oughteſt to doo vnto him. Therefore thou ſhalt cauſe his hoare head to goe downe to the graue with blood.</hi> Which after fell out worthily, becauſe he brake the commaundement that the King had giuen him vppon paine of death, and which he moſt willingly gaue his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto, ſo that his blood was vpon his owne head, and his death came to him through his owne default. Such is Gods gracious goodnes to ſuffer the wicked for a time, deferring their puniſhment which euery houre they deſerue, and hée might put in execution, and will no doubt performe it all in<note place="margin">Quod differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertur.</note> his time. For either they be cut off by a violent death, or ſome way or other, God ſheweth his greeuous iudgements on them. Though God withhold his hand, yet he ſtriketh at length, and they ſhall not alwayes ſcape ſcotfrée, that thinke themſelues to be innocent. When the Ammorites had filled the meaſure of their ſinne, Gods deſtruction came vpon them, and when the time of the wicked is come, they ſhall know themſelues to be guiltie. The teares go among good corne vntill the harueſt, but at harueſt, the teares are burnt, and the good corne is brought into the barne &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. The wicked are among the iuſt, and often are ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this world, but in the world to come they paie for it, when the iuſt and innocent ſhall be receiued into ioy. Who
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7821:57"/>
thoughte themſelues more holie, then <hi>Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that murmured againſt the ſeruant of God, <hi>Moſes?</hi> but the earth deuoured them, to ſhewe that there was neither holineſſe nor innocencie in them. Some mens ſinnes go before vnto iudgement, and ſome follow after. Some are puniſhed in this life for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample vnto others, and ſome eſcape vntill their dying day. But as after death commeth iudgement, ſo then ſhall it heauily be laide to their charge, neither ſhall they be pronounced innocent. As God is holie and innocent, ſo no wicked and vncleane perſon, ſhall come into his reſt. For without the gates of his heauenly Citie, ſhall be dogges and inchaunters, and whoremongers, and all wicked perſons, who when their houre is come, ſhall be rewarded according to their deſertes. A guiltie life, will haue a fearefull death, and torments wayt in an other world, for careleſſe finners in this world. Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and innocent can neuer agrée, no more can life and death, heauen and hell, which may well put vs in mind of our eſtate, leaſt we be numbred and plagued among the guiltie and vngodly. Elſe when we looke for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we may méete with iudgement. For commonly this is in euerie mans minde, and this is his reſolution, if they can eſcape the daunger of mans lawe, although they be neuer ſo much faultie, they thinke themſelues as cleare as the beſt, and that no man is able to laie any thing to their charge. It may bee that we may goe for honeſt in the ſight of the world, but before god and in his fight, we ſhall neuer be taken for innocent.</p>
                     <p>Againe, this clauſe is well put in, to make vs not to be too bold, or to preſume of gods mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as wee ſee his mercy and gracious kindneſſe is ſo often remembred.

The infinit multitude of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtars ſhew forth his wonderfull wiſdome, and decketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauens much more, then all the precious ſtones &amp; coſtly ornaments y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are in princes courts. Caſt down your eies, &amp; behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatures on the earth. The mighty lion which is a figure of gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, at whoſe roaring all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſts of the forreſt do tremble; the rauening beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtrument of his wrath, as the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the mocking children that did diſdain the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha,</hi> doth teſtifie; the nouriſhing &amp; cloathing creatures, the cow, the ſhéep, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goat, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſe of his goodnes. Wherin alſo the trées do inſtruct vs, the oliue trée with his fatneſſe, the figtrée with his ſwéetneſſe, the vine trée with his cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing. How do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearbes ſet forth the wiſedom of God? In that he hath giuen to euery hearbe his propertie, ſome for comfort, ſome for delight, ſome to continue life, ſome to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore life, as none know it better then the expert Phiſitian, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath opened his wonderfull works therin. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, looke vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lilly of the field, whom God hath ſo richly arraied, that <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his roialty is not like to one of theſe. A wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der it is, to ſée how he hath hid great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in the lower parts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, not only tin &amp; lead, braſſe and iron, but ſiluer alſo &amp; gold, &amp; precious ſtones. The earth, the world, &amp; euery part therof, giue manifeſt witneſſe, what God hath wrought. Euery element is furniſhed with his creatures, the aire with birds, the earth with trées &amp; hearbs and ineſtimable treaſure; and as the waues of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, ſo are the creatures therein conteined; euen as the ſtars of the ſkie, which no man can terme &amp; call by their names, but only God himſelf.

of the ſea, as the hidden work of God, <hi>Adam</hi> ſaw not, man knoweth not, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they euer be ſearched out, that we may wonder at Gods wonders. Some haue ſaid, that there is no creature on the earth, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea doth yéeld y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like. Among the creatures of the ſea, none ſetteth forth the work of Gods creation ſo much, as the huge &amp; great whale, which ouerturneth mightie ſhips, and ſtriketh a feare into the hart of man. As ſaith the Pſalm 104. 24. <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy works! In wiſdom haſt thou made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all; The earth is full of thy riches, ſo is the wide &amp; great ſea alſo, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both ſmall and great beaſtes. There goe the ſhips, and there is that Leuiathan whom thou haſt made to take his paſtime therein.</hi> When the wiſe man had delighted himſelf with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remembrance of the works of Gods creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either being rauiſhed with the delight, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſatiſfie his mind, he breaketh forth &amp; ſaith; <hi>Who hath ſeen all the creatures of God, that he might tell vs?</hi> For when he hath ſearched to the vtmoſt of his power, yet may he truly ſay; There are hid yet greater things then theſe be, and we haue ſéen but a fewe of his works. He doth not meaſure the knowledge of man in this matter, that he hath attained the one halfe, but leaueth him in the very enterance, as though he had had but a glimce of ſome, and not a ſight of all. As <hi>Adam</hi> being placed in Paradice, had not a full view of all the ſecretes thereof, neither had he any vnderſtanding of the trée of life, but aſſoone as he had taſted of the trée of knowledge, for his rebellion and diſobedience, he ſtaid not long there. Let vs therfore ſatiſfie our ſelues with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods creatures, if it be but in a meaſure, &amp; be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented though we ſée not all; but by and in them that we doo know, let vs praiſe &amp; honor him, who in ſuch comely &amp; bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, &amp; vnſearchable ſort hath made all. <hi>Timantes</hi> a cunning Painter, taking in hand, to expreſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorow of <hi>Agamemno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of his daughter <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> &amp; perceiuing his ſkill wold not reach ſo far, couered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince his face with a vaile, leauing his ſorrow to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beholders,

whoſe eyes in this reſpect he could not ſatiſfie. In like ſort, finding my ſelf vnable to fulfill thy deſire, and to ſet downe the conſideration of all Gods creatures, thinke it good to leaue the reſt to thy ſtudie and labour, and take that to be ſufficient for this preſent purpoſe, which I haue ſaid, vſing ſilence where much may be ſpared, thy ſtudie eaſed, and minde delighted. For breuitie bringeth attention, and a long diſcourſe tediouſnes. The learned Philoſophers and ſearchers of gods works, perceiuing the excellency of gods creatures, and the bewtifull frame of the world, gaue it a a name agréeable thereunto, and called it Bewtie it ſelfe. For if the works of men deſerue great commendation, and that the Carpenter in the frame of his houſe, the Maſon in his ſtoneworke, the Painter in his pictures may excel, how much more excellent, and paſſing bewtifull, ſhall the frame of the whole world be, and the workmanſhip of euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made and ordeined and created of God? Who, as he is in all reſpects worthie praiſe, ſo doubtleſſe muſt the works be which procéed from him, infinit, incomprehenſible, only good, only almightie, only wiſe, only excellent, in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer may be ſaid to be his.</p>
                     <p>When the Diſciples of our Sauiour Chriſt, ſhewed<note place="margin">VVhether to endure.</note> him the faire building of the Temple and the garniſhed worke, <hi>Maruell ye at theſe things, ſaith he? The time ſhall come, that there ſhall not be a ſtone left vpon a ſtone, which ſhall not be throwne downe.</hi> The Temple it ſelfe, yea euen the bewtifull gate of the Temple, ſhall come to hauocke and ruine. There is nothing excellent in the world, that is of long continuance, and the world it ſelf hath but his time, and ſhall paſſe away as though it had neuer bene, nor euer created, not through the default of the workemanſhip, but through their procurement, for whoſe benefit it was made and created. Shewe me the light which will not darken, ſhewe me the flower which will not fade, ſhewe me the frute which will not corrupt, ſhewe me the garment which will not weare, ſhewe me the ſtrength which wil not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

ſhewe me the bewtie which will not wither, ſhewe me the time which will not paſſe, and tell me if thou canſt, whether that the worlde bee of the continuance but of an houre. The ende whereof, is compared to the trauaile of a woman, the comming of a théefe in the night, the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of lightning, ſodaine and vnlooked for, in a moment, in the turning of a hand, in the twinkling of an eye, before a man can ſay, what is done, or what is towardes. For as GOD ſaid, <hi>It repenteth mee that euer I made man:</hi> ſo not long after, he vttered his voyce to Noah, and ſayd; <hi>An end is come.</hi> He created man and he fell, he made the world, and it ſhall not alwayes endure. Man was made out of the duſt, and to duſt he ſhall returne; the world was made of nothing, and to nothing ſhall it vaniſh; it ſhall ware olde as a garment, and at length be conſumed with fire. The goodneſſe of the Lorde is great in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the worlde, and longer ſhould the time be, if the wickedneſſe of men did not abounde. Which time, if it were not ſhortned, no fleſh ſhould be ſaued, but for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects ſake, for the benefit of the good and godly, the dayes of the world ſhall be cut off. <hi>Let mee alone, ſaith God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that I may conſume this people vtterly.</hi> Now come many miſeries, loſſes, extremities and plagues vppon the world, but for the ſin that is practiſed in the world. Which doubtleſſe will be the cauſe of the ende of the world, and of the deſtruction of gods bewtiful frame, fire and brimſtone fell vpon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> a part of the world, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if it had pleaſed God, it might haue lighted on all the world. The windowes aboue, and the depthes beneath, were opened, and the whole earth was ouerwhelmed with water. A token of a greater iudgement, and of a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, when not a part of the earth ſhall bee conſumed with fire, but the whole earth, yea euen the heauens alſo and the whole world it ſelfe. The glorious Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſſe, and the Moone into blood, the ſtarres ſhall fall from heauen, and the powers of the heauen ſhall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7821:61"/>
be ſhaken, the earth ſhall be diſſolued, the ſea and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall roare. And if the wordes of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> bee true, as without all peraduenture they are moſte certaine, becauſe the ſpirite of God hath ſet them downe, which cannot lie, neither can be deceiued; as the world of old periſhed, being ouerflowne with water; ſo the heauens and the earth which are now, are kept by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God in ſtore, and reſerued vnto fire, againſt the day of iudgement, and of the deſtruction of vngodly men. This latter day, the end of the world, ſhall come as a theefe in the night, in the which the heauens ſhal paſſe away with a noiſe, and the elements ſhal melt with heat, and the earth with the workes that are therin, ſhall be burnt vp. Sin, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and wickednes, ſaith the wiſe man, hath caſt downe the thrones of the mightie, and brought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth to a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſo it ſhal fal out, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> therby all things ſhalbe brought to deſolation, and not only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth but the whole world ſhal come to nothing. Yet thrée daies, and Niniue ſhalbe deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet but a while, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> a litle while, and the time of the world ſhalbe expired. For the end of all things is at hand. Plentifull <hi>Sodom,</hi> &amp; bewtiful <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> are defaced, their beaſtly luſtes, and the abuſing of Gods benefits, was the cauſe; Man ſhould neuer haue died, if he had neuer diſobei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the bewtie of the world ſhould ſtill haue continued, if the inhabitants of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world had giuen no other cauſe. But now all things tend to their decay, the heauenly powers do faile in their operations, and the hearbes haue not their former force, and the Phiſitian is driuen to vncertainties. The bodie of man is not ſo perfect and healthfull as in the beginning, but ſubiect to manifold diſeaſes, his time hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not out to hundreths as heretofore it hath done, but fewe are his daies, becauſe his daies are euill. Death to man, deſtruction to the world, yea all the creatures of the earth do grone vnder the burthen of that miſterie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are ſubiect by man, and hope to be deliuered of it, and hope to be purged from their corruption. When
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7821:61"/>
our Sauiour Chriſt came neare to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he wept, to thinke of the deſolation and deſtruction that ſhould come on <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that faire and bewtifull <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and wonder of all the earth. And the more that wée knowe the excellent woorke of God in the creation of the worlde and his creatures, wherein we cannot chooſe but take paſſing delight, ſo often as we doo conſider and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the ſame, euen there withall alſo, when we thinke that all thinges ſhall come to a ruine and downefall, that the heauens and the earth ſhall be conſumed with fire, then may we begin to ſhead forth teares, in a lamentable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that ſo glorious a workemanſhip, and ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a frame, ſhould come to a finall deſtruction. When <hi>Eliſha</hi> the man of God, looked ſtedfaſtly vppon <hi>Hazael,</hi> he<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 12</note> wept, becauſe hee foreſawe what great miſerie hee ſhould worke againſt the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Which thing ſaith he, the Lord hath ſhewed me. The woes that ſhall come vpon the worlde in the latter time, ſhall make the godly minded to mourne in their thoughtes. <hi>Reue. 12. 12. <hi>Wo to the inhabitants of the earth and of the ſea, for the diuell is come downe vnto you, which hath great wrath, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee hath but a ſhort time, and that his miſchiefe ouer the world, ſhall ende with the world.</hi>
                        </hi> Which thing maketh them to wiſh, that their liues were at an ende, that they might not behold ſuch great calamities, as alſo to reioyce at their eſtate, which haue leſt the earth and poſſeſſe the heauens. <hi>Oh</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, ca. 9. 1. <hi>that mine head were full of water, and mine eyes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of teares, that I might weepe day and night for my people, euen for the ſlaine of my people;</hi>
                        </hi> as if he had ſaid, for them that are and ſhall be deſtroyed. Becauſe they are all adulterers, and an aſſembly of rebels. This is a waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cauſe, to make vs all to wéepe, which cauſe alſo doth make the earth and all creatures elſe, to mourn and grone. <hi>Go to now ye rich men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle S. <hi>Iames, <hi>weepe &amp; houle;</hi>
                        </hi> and ſo might he haue warned al people, &amp; all ſorts,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7821:62"/>
and all degrées to wéepe, as King <hi>Hezechias</hi> did, when he turned his face to the wall, being ſorie that he had offended God, and that an end was come vnto him therfore; to weep as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> did, bitterly, for his gréeuous ſin, whereby hée forſooke his Lord and maiſter. Let this make euery one to wéepe, both for others and for themſelues, in their chambers and in their cloſets, at home and abroad, where euer they go, and what euer they do, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that the ſinnes of others, as alſo their owne ſinnes, ſhould be the cauſe of ſo great an ouerthrow. <hi>Turne vnto mee with all your heart, and with faſting, and with weepiing, and with mourning, and rent your harts and not your clothes, and turn vnto the Lord your God,</hi> ſaith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet. For who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whether God will return &amp; leaue a bleſſing. Let euery one thus wéepe for themſelues, and thus turne vnto the Lord; for who knoweth whether God will change his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and forget our ſinnes. And though death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, be a heauy plague that ſhall light vpon the moſt part of the inhabitants of the world, I ſay, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whether this ſhall turne to vs for a great bleſſing. The conſideration of which bleſſing, will make vs turne our teares into ioy, and our mourning into mirth, not ſuch ioy as the worlde, but as the ſpirit of God ſhall mooue our hearts vnto; It ſhall make vs lift vp our heades, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that when the ende of the world ſhall be, our perfect redemption ſhall bee accompliſhed. Finally, it ſhall alſo make vs more warie by this warning. According to that of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter, <hi>The ende of all thinges is at hande. Bee yee therefore ſober and watching in prayer. Take heed</hi>
                        </hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>leaſt that day come on you vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares. For as a ſnare, ſhall it come on the face of the whole earth.</hi> Take héed leaſt ye be taken in ſurfetting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, in chambering and wantonneſſe; Take héed leſt ye be choked with the cares of this world, and be too earthly &amp; worldly minded, when ye ſhuld be heuenly minded, ſéeing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world ſhal haue an end, and we know not how ſoone,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7821:62"/>
nor how ſodaine it ſhall be. Loue not the worlde, nor the delights of the world, and let not thy heart cleaue thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but lift vp thy heart and thy mind to heauen and an other life, whereas thy dwelling is like to be for euermore, if ſo be thou beeſt not thy own hindrance, and be taken amongſt the fiue ſléepie and fooliſh virgines ſpoken of in the Goſpell.<note place="margin">Qualis vita finis ita.</note> For as the trée falleth ſo it lieth, and if in the ende of the world, nay in the ende of thy life (which is the ende of the world to thée) ſhall be fire and flame, ſo thy ende ſhall be hell fire, and ſuch gréeuous torments which can neuer be vttered, and ſhall neuer be ended.</p>
                     <p>The ſeconde principall conſideration which I noted<note place="margin">2</note> vnto you in this text, is; Howe and after what ſort the world and all the creatures therein conteined were made, conſiſting on theſe thrée circumſtaunces. Firſt, that God<note place="margin">Of nothing.</note> made all things of nothing. Secondly, that they were made by his word and commandement. Thirdly, that all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were created verie good. A ſtraunge and incredible maner, that God ſhould make all things of nothing. Yet as we reade in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, Chapter 11. 3. <hi>Through faith we vnderſtand, that the world was ordeined by the word of God, ſo that the things which we ſee, are not made of things which did appeare. For he made all things of nothing, when as yet there was none of them.</hi> Wherein the Apoſtle doeth well attribute the matter vnto faith; for by our naturall reaſon, we were neuer able to comprehend it, but contrariwiſe, we ſhould thinke it a matter too abſurd and againſt reaſon. As alſo in the conception of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, that he ſhould be borne of a pure virgin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of man, hath ſéemed vnto many, a matter in no wiſe to be beléeued. In ſo much, that ſome haue bene bold to ſay, and their ſpéech vngodly inough, that the bodie of our Sauiour Chriſt was rather a fained bodie, then a bodie like vnto ours of fleſh and blood. Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaid vnto his diſciples, That it was eaſier for a rope to paſſe through
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7821:63"/>
the eye of a néedle, then for a rich man to enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Whereat they maruelled, ſaying; Who then ſhall be ſaued? To whom Chriſt anſwered. <hi>To men this ſeemes impoſſible, but to God all thinges are poſſible.</hi> And herein is the difference betwixt the workes of God and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they can bring nothing to paſſe but by means, but God ſheweth his power vnto vs, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> without meanes of nothing, he can doo all thinges. <hi>Sarah Abrahams</hi> wife laughed, when ſhée heard that ſhée ſhould haue a ſonne in her olde age, ſéeing it had ceaſed to be with her after the manner of women, and that her wombe had ſo long bene barreine, and as it was to be thought now dead. What ſaith ſhée, after I am waxed olde, and my Lord alſo, ſhall I haue luſt? But the Angel anſwered; <hi>Shall any thing be heard to the Lord? who as of nothing made infinit crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo cauſed he of one, euen of one which was dead, to ſpring, ſo many as the ſtarres of the skie in multitude, and as the ſande of the ſea which is innumerable.</hi> What more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible then to put life into a ſtone? Yet ſaith <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> vnto the Iewes, that boaſted themſelues, that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie, <hi>God is able of theſe ſtones, to raiſe vp children vnto Abraham.</hi> Howe ſhould we ſay in the Articles of our beliefe, <hi>I beleeue in God the father Almightie,</hi> vnleſſe wee were fully perſwaded that hee were able to doo all things whatſoeuer he would. Which things alſo the Diuels knowe and doo beleeue. Elſe the tempter woulde not haue ſaide vnto Chriſt; <hi>If thou be the ſonne of God, commaund that theſe ſtones be made bread.</hi> What fooliſhneſhneſſe is it then for vs, to meaſure the infinit power of God, within the narrow ſtrait of our owne conceit. Much like the ſeruant of the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha,</hi> who ſawe nothing, when as there were round about his maiſter and himſelfe, horſes and char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ts of fire, the mountaine full. Yet this matter of Gods Almightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, is more manifeſt in the reſurrection, that after our bodies haue béene conſumed to earth and aſhes, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7821:63"/>
hath beene meate for the foules of the aire, the beaſtes of the earth, and the fiſhes of the ſea, when euery part and parcell of our bodies are brought to nothing, yet ſhall they returne to their former eſtate, and be renued againe. As <hi>Iobe</hi> ſaith; <hi>I hope to ſee my Redeemer in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day, not with anie other, but with theſe ſame eyes.</hi> What is it for him when all thinges are vaniſhed, and conſumed to nothing, to bid them returne againe; who as the Prophet faith, <hi>Renueth the face of the earth, and doth cloath it yearely as it were with a newe garment.</hi> What is it for him to make a plentifull lande barraine, and to bring foorth nothing, as hée did by the lande of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and to make a barraine land to be plentifull, and to bring foorth all things. For as hée tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the flouds into a wilderneſſe, and drieth vp the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpringes, Pſal. 107. 35. So againe, he maketh the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe a ſtanding water, &amp; water ſprings of a dry ground. Darknes and light to him are both alike, ſo is it his onely propertie, both to make all thinges of nothing, and that there ſhould be nothing impoſſible vnto him. Wherefore let vs not fooliſhly imagine, that out of nothing, nothing can be made, as ſome haue thought, and thoſe not mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned, but when we come to the view of the workes of God, all learning and wiſedome of man muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. And although we reade, that man was made of the duſt of the earth, the fiſhes and foules of the water, the woman of man, yet the firſt beginning of all things was of nothing: let vs with <hi>Iobe. cap.</hi> 26. 7. beholde yet a little more nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, very manifeſtly and alſo with great delight. The wordes of Iobe are theſe. <hi>Hee hangeth the earth vpon</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. <hi>Eſd.</hi> 16. 501.</note> 
                        <hi>nothing.</hi> VVhiche thing is ſubiect euen to our ſences. For the heauens euerie way foorthe doo compaſſe the Earth and the Sea, and the Earth and the Sea ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of it ſelfe without any manner helpe, but onelie from GOD. And although euerie one cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſo muche, yet the learneder ſorte haue tryed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7821:64"/>
it, and found it out by learning, and ſome paſſengers and trauellers, if not by land, yet by ſea haue aduentured it. If it hang vpon nothing, wonder not. For God hath laide the foundations of the earth, Pſal. 104. 5. that it neuer ſhould mooue at any time, making it faſt, and giuing it a lawe which ſhould neuer be broken, till he ſaw good, and that all ſhould be ended.</p>
                     <p>But that we ſhould be ſomewhat more reſolued in this<note place="margin">By his word.</note> doubtfull matter, this we are to learne, that as God made all things of nothing that did appeare, ſo alſo he performed this wonderfull worke, onely by the word of his mouth. The Potter maketh his veſſels out of the claie, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter buildeth his houſe of timber, the Smith forgeth his inſtruments out of iron, but ſhewe me the workeman that can but wiſh his woorke made ready to his handes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other helpe, but onely to haue it for the wiſhing. Onely and alone it was God that commanded and ſaid, <hi>Let it be ſo,</hi> and it was ſo. Pſal. 135. 6. For whatſoeuer it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, that did he in the heauen, and in the earth, in the ſea, and in all déepe places. To vs that haue a very ſmal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in the infinit works and power of God, it ſéemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould bee ſo, yet the word of God which is the foundation of all truth, hath certified vs that it is ſo.

For he ſpake and it was done, he commanded, and it ſtood.</hi> His ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall power, was in his word and commandement. In the beginning God created the heauen and the earth, and ſaid; <hi>Let there be light, and there was light; Let there be a afirmament, and it was ſo; Let the earth bud forth hearbes and trees, and it was ſo; Let there be lights in the heauen, and there were lights; Let there be foules in the aire and fiſhes in the ſea, and there were multitudes, and God was deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the worke; Let the earth bring foorth all beaſtes and cattell, and preſently they were to be ſeene.</hi> This was that eternall word of God, which was before all things, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graued
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7821:64"/>
forme of the image of God, the ſecond perſon in the godhead, by the which all things were made. This was the word of God which was before his works of old, which was ſet vp from euerlaſting, from the beginning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the earth. When there were no depthes, neither any fountaines abounding with water, before the mountaines were ſetled, and before the hilles, he had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the duſt in the world, when he prepared the heauens it was there, and when he ſet the compaſſe of the déepe. When he eſtabliſhed the cloudes aboue, when he confirmed the fountaines of the déepe, when he gaue his decrée to the ſea, that the water ſhould not paſſe his commaundement; when he appointed the foundation of the earth; then was his word with him a nouriſher, and it was his daily delight, reioycing alway before him. She is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence that floweth from the glory of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; She is the brightneſſe of the euerlaſting light, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled mirrour of the maieſtie of God, and the image of his goodneſſe. Which being one, ſhe can do all things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in her ſelfe, renueth all. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and that word was God; The ſame was in the beginning with God. Al things were made by it, and without it was made nothing that was made. In it was life, euen the life of all gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, quickning and preſeruing all things, and in great wiſedome diſpoſing all things in their due order. So that the wiſe man might well call it the delight of God, which ſitteth about his throne, and the bewty of all his creatures, through the beholding wherof, it pleaſed God to pronounce and ſay, <hi>That all things that were made were very good, and in reſpect of their workemanſhip excellent.</hi>

                     <p>This alſo is woorthie the marking, in the worke of gods creation, that whereas in the workes of all earthly creatures, there is labour and ſweate, and wearineſſe, god by his almightie power brought this wonderfull matter to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7821:65"/>
paſſe, with great eaſe, with great delight and ioy. It was no more with him but his word and his commandement, onely it was his will it ſhould be ſo. At whoſe will and word and commaundement, as all the liuing creatures were made, which he in his infinit wiſedome thought good off, ſo alſo might hee haue cauſed many more to bee made and created, not becauſe he was a weary of his worke, but becauſe hée thought it not expedient. Yet ſome may thinke that Gods Creation was a laboure vnto him, and a weariſome labour, becauſe we reade, that he reſted the ſeuenth day, from all his worke which he had made. VVhich he did not, becauſe he fainted as it were vnder the burthen of ſo waightie a buſineſſe, (for it was neither a buſineſſe nor a matter of waight, nor a burthen vnto him) or for his eaſe and refreſhing, but onely for his delight, and further contentation, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it was his will, and that it ſo pleaſed him. The eaſineſſe of this woorke is ſo muche the more to be wondred at, not onely that it was without paine and wearineſſe, but alſo that he did both vndertake and finiſh the ſame of his owne accord, and of himſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other helpes and meanes. Nothing excellent, nay if it be neuer ſo meane, that is done on the Earth, but hath great helpes. The Citie and the Tower which <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and his company went about to build, the top whereof, they purpoſed ſhould reach vnto the heauens, (a mirrour to the worlde if it might haue bene finiſhed) was it done by one or by two? No, an infinit multitude put their heades and their hands to it, and all little inough. There were Carpenters, and Maſons, and ſuche as ſhould make bricke, and burne it in the fire; there were maiſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſers, and maiſter builders, and inferiour drudges, and a number of labourers, as thicke as the ſwarmes of <hi>Egypt.</hi> They laboured all ioyntly, with heart and hand, heauing and ſhouing, toyling and ſweating, and all to no purpoſe, to their great griefe and diſcontentment, for all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7821:65"/>
was daſht. How were the <hi>Pyramides</hi> of <hi>Egipt,</hi> thoſe famous monuments, erected and ſet vp, as eaſie think you, as if one ſtone might be laide? View the building but of a ſmal cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and ſay what a buſie piece of worke it it. But with God was no ſuch thing, he was all alone, and there was none other; he begunne it, and he brought it to paſſe; hée commaunded, and neuer laboured; he created, and neuer reſted; vntill all was as you ſée. The night and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe come vppon man, and hée muſt of neceſſitie leaue off. That creature which hath not his reſt, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his ſtrength to labour. When the Sunne riſeth, man goeth foorth to his woorke and to his labour, but how long? If ſixe or ſeuen houres togither, without ſome foode and ſome refreſhing, it is a maruell, but if hee continue vntill the euening, hée can ſtaie no longer at it, for the weakeneſſe of his bodie will not ſuffer him, and the light of the day is cloſed vp with night and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Againe, the woorkes of men may haue manie chaunges, before they come to perfection, and the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man himſelfe may bee diſpleaſed at his worke, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne anewe, but GOD as hee is vnchaungeable, ſo euen at the firſt was his worke perfect, without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. VVho hath made the earth by his power, and eſtabliſhed the world by his wiſedome, and hath ſtretched out the heauen by his diſcretion. <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 12.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, in the maner of Gods creation, this is<note place="margin">All good.</note> not the leaſt and meaneſt thing to be conſidered of; That all that God made was good. And God ſawe all that hee had made, and beholde it was verie good. Euery thing in his order and in his kind perfect, and abſolute, as ſaith the Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> though not durable and alwayes to continue. No maruell then if the learned did name the worlde to bee bewtie, ſéeing God himſelfe after hée had created all, ſawe that they were verie good. Alſo becauſe the maieſtie, wiſedome and power, gods workmanſhip, did giue a grace to euery thing to adorne it, and to ſet it foorth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7821:66"/>
to the commendation of man. The works of the Lord ſaith the Pſalme, are great, and worthie to be praiſed and had in honor, which alſo are ſought out of all them that haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therein. All the workes of the Lord ſaith the wiſe man are good, and he giueth euery one in due ſeaſon, and when need is. So that a man néed not ſay, this is worſe then that. For in due ſeaſon they are all worthie praiſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore praiſe the Lord with whole heart and mouth, and bleſſe the name of the Lord, who vpon all his workes hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red foorth his bleſſings, and hath made the wiſe and godly to beholde it, although this knowledge be kept from the wicked, who in no ſort are worthie to be partakers either of gods goodneſſe or of his bleſſings and comforts. None are ſo ſet to diſpraiſe and diſcommend, and to diſdain at gods workes and his creatures, as the wicked, which are readie to finde fault where they haue no cauſe, and to deſpiſe that, whereof they ſée no preſent vſe, and to curſe and abhorre thoſe creatures, whereby they may haue any hurt or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance. Yet certain it is, that god hath made nothing, that hath any fault, although many a graceleſſe people thinke ſo, which are deſtitute of wiſedome. For the one commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the goodnes of the other, and who can be ſatiſfied with beholding gods glory in them. For through him all things are directed to a good end. Many creatures ſéeme to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hurtful, and ſome wil ſay, what good is in them? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe god forelawe that the earth ſhould be filled and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited with two ſorts of people, the good &amp; the bad, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and the godly, for whoſe ſake, were created his benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and helpefull creatures, and his plaguing and reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging creatures. Which god in his wiſedome hath thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to frame vs to thankfulneſſe, to a reuerence and feare of his maieſtie, that we ſhould not offend him, or prouoke his anger againſt vs. And although the fooliſh mind of man may thinke ſome creatures of god to haue no goodneſſe in their creation, becauſe they that deſerue the contrary finde it not, yet in their nature they are good, becauſe they are
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7821:66"/>
the worke of God, and this is their goodneſſe, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Gods puniſhments. A notable example whereof, we ſée in the Prophecie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> concerning his malicious enemies and wicked accuſers, who when they were caſt vnto the lions, were torne in pieces, before they came to the ground, which if they had done vpon a rauening kinde of nature, it would haue bene ſéene vpon <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelfe, who was caſt amongſt the lions before they were, and yet was not touched. To giue a manifeſt proofe vnto vs, that God hath made them to execute his wrath, and hath ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to a good ende, though in their tune they bee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and moſt hurtfull. Which as yet more manifeſtly it appeareth in the examples of the Prophets, that diſobeyed Gods commandement, and was therefore ſlaine by a lion, whereof we reade, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 13. The old Prophet which had cauſed the yoong Prophet to tranſgreſſe Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they were ſitting at the table, the word of the Lord came vnto him, and he cried vnto the yoong Prophet, ſaying; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou haſt diſobeyed the mouth of the Lord, and haſt not kept the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Lord the God commanded thee, but cameſt backe againe, and haſt eaten bread and drunke water, in the place, whereof hee did ſay vnto thee; Thou ſhalt eate no bread, nor drinke any water; therefore thy carkaſſe ſhal not come into the ſepulchre of thy fathers.</hi> So when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was departed and gone, a lion met him by the way and ſlew him, and his bodie was caſt in the way, and the aſſe ſtood therby; the lion ſtood by the corps alſo. The aſſe which is wont to be the praie of the lion, was vnhurt, the hungry lion ſtood by, as though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e had no luſt to eate; becauſe God had ſhut his mouth to ſhewe his iudgement, and therefore the lion ſtood ſtill, till other came to behold the ſame, and as it were to beare witneſſe. In the lion we may behold gods wiſedome in all other cruell and terrible beaſts, who neuer rage till men be come to an outlawe, I meane when they forget God and themſelues, then doth God vſe the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7821:67"/>
of his reuenging creatures, becauſe hee would haue good order kept, and that men ſhould liue in awe, and as we ſay, vnder a lawe, euen Gods lawe, which is moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy. This is not ordinary, for God hath put the ſword into the Magiſtrates hand to puniſh offendors, and to cut them off, but ſometimes he puniſheth extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As we reade, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 39. 28. 32. There be ſpirits that are created for vengeance, which in their rigour lay on ſure ſtrokes. In the time of deſtruction, they ſhewe forth their power, and accompliſh the wrath of him that made them. Fire and haile, and famine, and death, all theſe are created for vengeance. The téeth of wilde beaſtes, and the ſcorpions, and the ſerpents, and the ſword, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vengeance for the deſtruction of the wicked. They ſhall be glad to doo his commaundements, and when néed is, they ſhall be readie vppon earth, and when their houre is come, they ſhall not ouerpaſſe the commaundement. The night and darkneſſe is created of God to a good end, that all his creatures may take reſt therein, yet was it a gréeuous puniſhment vnto the Egiptians, and a forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of helliſh darkneſſe. Frogges and lice, and graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and ſuch creatures, lightly do no great hurt, but when God would puniſh the Egiptians his enemies, by them, they came among them in aboundance, and in ſwarmes, and moleſted them gréeuouſly, in ſo much that the land did ſtinke with their huge heaps. No creature we think ſo vgly to looke to, as a toad, yet it is a good creature of God, and in his time deſerueth praiſe. The phiſitian knoweth it, which creature, though ſome do vſe to miſchief, yet he to medicine; for he draweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue &amp; dried po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Againe, God doth make this creature commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto vs, if it were for nothing elſe but for the precious ſtone which is found in him, and therfore is ſet in gold, and ſome do weare it in their rings, being there delectable to their ſight, which otherwiſe they take to bee ſo loathſome.

Concerning all hurtfull creatures, which in their creation are good, if we find our ſelues agréeued, let vs conſider and waigh the matter with greater deliberation, and we ſhall then finde, that no creature had bene hurtfull, if man had not bene ſinfull. So that now the fault of man is to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and lamented, not Gods creation, which is highly to be honored, &amp; cannot ſufficiently be praiſed. The moſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creature, that euer was, or is, or ſhalbe, I meane the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, let vs conſider Gods worke in him. For he was made angel of heauen, which for his pride was caſt downe into hell, and forced to dwell in bottomleſſe darkeneſſe, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with euerlaſting torments. In reſpect of which his excellent creation, the hiſtory of Iob numbreth him among the children of God, that is, his Angels. As in the chapter 1. v. 6. <hi>Now on a day when the children of God came and ſtood before the Lord, Sathan came alſo among them.</hi> Alſo the Prophet <hi>Michaah,</hi> 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 22. 19. ſpeaking of the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of King <hi>Achab</hi> by a falſe ſpirite, generally amongſt Gods angels, maketh mention of him. The diuel was good at the firſt, how hurtfull ſo euer he is now. Which is a good inſtruction to vs that ſtand, or rather that thinke we ſtand, leſt we fall away from God as he did, and ſo be partakers of his wofull miſeries. Laſtly, let vs beholde our ſelues, next to the angels, none more excellently created then we, but as the diuel fell away from God and all goodneſſe, ſo by our diſobedience in our firſt parents, did we deſerue the like puniſhment, and in like ſort to bee caſt away, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God in great mercy had taken compaſſion on vs, and deliuered vs from the gates of hell. For whoſe goodneſſe we haue the greater cauſe to be thankfull, that he gaue his onely ſonne to death for the redemption of mankind, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by and leauing theſe rebellious Angelles in their curſed eſtate. And to ſée, no creatures haue defaced gods worke ſo much as they, that were his moſte excellent creatures, and of whome it might haue bene very well ſaide, They are verie good. So that almightie God
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7821:68"/>
was highly diſpleaſed, and ſorrie that he had created them, wondring as it were with himſelfe, that ſo great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould ouergrow and ouerwhelme his excellent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as though light had bene put out in vtter darkeneſſe, and life for euer ſwallowed vp of death. For after a while God ſawe that the wickedneſſe of man was great in the earth, and that all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart were onely euil continually. Then his mercy and his wrath did ſtrine togither, now for pittie he mourned, and then in iuſtice he thought vpon puniſhment to deſtroy them from the face of the earth. All the workes of God were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good, but let vs be hold y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> works which are now brought into the world, which being neuer made by God, are crept in by the diuels malice, and mans corruption, as breaches and blots of Gods order, and of his good creation. Such are ſinne, deformitie, confuſion, tyrannie, calamitie, death and deſtruction. Which workes deſerue hatred and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are farre from praiſe and commendation. For they are the horrible deprauation, of the order firſt made by god. For god hath not made death, neither hath he pleaſure in the deſtruction of the liuing. For he created all things that they might haue their being, and the generations of the world are preſerued, and there is no poiſon of deſtruction in them. Concupiſcence is not of the father, but of the world; Sinne came of the diuell; Death through ſinne.

Romanes, Chapter 1. 20. <hi>For the inuiſible things of him, that is, his eternall power and Godhead are ſeene by the creation of the world, being conſidered in his workes.</hi> But ſo vaine are men by nature, and ignorant of God, that they cannot know him by the good thinges that are ſéene, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider by the workes the morkemaiſter. For they haue thought, the fire, or the winde, ſwift aire, or the courſe of the ſtarres, or the raging water, or the lights of heauen to be gouernours of the worlde and gods. Who though they had ſuch pleaſure in their beautie, that they thought them gods, yet ſhould they haue knowne, how much more excellent he is that made them. For the firſt authour of beautie, hath created theſe thinges. Or if they maruelled at the power and operation of them, (for in his creatures God ſheweth his power) yet ſhould they haue perceiued thereby, howe much hée that made theſe thinges is mightier. For by the beautie and greatneſſe of the creatures, the Creator being compared with them, may bee conſidered. Hée walketh vppon the cloudes, and bringeth the windes out of his treaſure, hée ruleth the raging of the ſea, the Lorde God of hoſtes is his name, hée is the Lorde of power.

How ſhould the ſea part it ſelfe and ſtand vpon heapes, as it did to giue the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſage, and to ſet them frée from their enemies? Howe ſhoulde the earth open and ſwallowe vp people as it hath done, to execute Gods iuſt iudgements? An example whereof, wee haue in <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and ſince their time hath bene ſéene in the worlde? Howe ſhould all this come ſo to paſſe, vnleſſe onely it were to ſet foorth the glorious and fearefull name of the Lorde. This made the people to wonder at the great power and might of our Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, in taming the raging of the Sea, and breaking the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame force of the bluſtering windes. For hee rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the winde and the waues of water, and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ceaſed, and it was calme againe as before.

the windes and water and they obey him; Glorifying God, becauſe they neuer ſawe any ſuch thing. The hurtfull creatures that God hath made, euen by them his glorie doth more appeare. The white hath a fairer ſhewe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared with blacke; the comfort of the daie, is made more manifeſt, by conſidering the diſcomfort of the night and darkeneſſe: after ſicknes wée are more thankefull for our health, and hurtfull creatures do make vs more to eſtéeme the benifit of gods goodnes, in the helpe of thoſe creatures which are for our vſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. For God in great wiſedome, hath made as well hurtfull things as others, that by contraries a fuller knowledge might grow in man, to the praiſe of God, that hath done all ſo well. Concerning which hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full creatures, let vs not be too raſh, but bridle our thoughts with wiſdome and moderation. For although preſentlie and at the verie firſt ſight, wée knowe not the good of a creature, yet God is not therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly to bee miſliked for creating the ſame, who maye doo with his owne as pleaſeth him beſt. Againe, many creatures there are, which ſéeme to ſerue to no vſe, yet moſt certaine it is, that God hath made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vaine. And a man néede not to ſay, What is this? Wherefore is that? For he hath made all things for their owne vſe. Wherein let vs referre all to Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wiſedome, who knew what was beſt for his glorie. And although the vſe of them be vnprofitable to vs, yet is it wel knowne to God, and let vs be of the ſame mind with the Apoſtle ſaying, Of him, and through him, and for him, are all things, to whom be praiſe and glorie for euer, Amen. Neither let vs be backwards in giuing God this glorie due vnto him, ſéeing the creatures themſelues do glorifie God in their obedience. The ſtarres ſhine in their watch and reioyce. When he calleth them they ſay, Here we be; and ſo with chearfulneſſe they ſhewe light to him that made them. And of al the reſt of gods creatures ſo
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7821:71"/>
it may be ſaid. Laſtly and principally, God hath made man, for his glory. For as he hath made all things for his owne ſake, ſo hath he made euen the wicked for the day of euill: Becauſe the iuſtice of God ſhall appeare to his glory, euen in the deſtruction of the wicked. For as the ſcripture ſaith vnto <hi>Pharach, <hi>For this ſame purpoſe haue I ſtirred thee vp, that I might ſhewe my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the world.</hi>
                        </hi> Again, as God would haue his power knowne, by ſuffering with long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the veſſels of wrath prepared to deſtruſtruction, ſo alſo was it his pleaſure to declare the riches of his glorie vpon the veſſels of mercy, which he hath prepared vnto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Who hath choſen vs in Chriſt before the foundations of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in loue, who hath predeſtinate vs to bee adopted through Ieſus Chriſt vnto himſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherewith he hath made vs accepted in his beloued. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God hath made the wicked againſt the euill day, to ſhewe his glory by his iuſtice, yet doth his glory more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the workes of mercy. For mercy reioyceth againſt iudgement, and his mercy is ouer all his woorkes. His wrath reacheth to the third and fourth generation, but his mercy vnto thouſands.</p>
                     <p>Aboue all other creatures, as God is gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull<note place="margin">For mans vſe.</note> vnto man, ſo alſo is he more bountiful vnto him, then vnto all the reſt. For he hath created all things for mans vſe, graunting vnto him moſt largely, and that more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, then any prince his gift can be in all his royaltie. For man was the world made and ordeined not for angels, nor for others creatures, but onely ſo farre foorth as they ſerue for the vſe and benefit of man. And what greater comfort can there be to the godly, then to thinke as God hath prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally created the heauenly Angels for his glory, ſo alſo ſecondarily for their benefit. There be reuenging Angels (as in the Pſalme 78. 50. God ſent euil Angels among the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7821:72"/>
Egiptians, and alſo in the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi>) the which laie on ſure ſtroakes on the wicked; and there be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Angels which wayt vppon the godly. As it is in the Pſalme; <hi>The Angell of the Lorde tarrieth rounde about them that feare him, and deliuereth them.</hi> As the Angels for the defence of <hi>Iacob</hi> againſt the iniurie of his brother <hi>Eſau;</hi> the Angell in the firie furnace, with the thrée chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the Angell that deliuered <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle out of priſon. <hi>Thou haſt man</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>lower then the Angels, and yet behold the goodneſſe of God, in that hee hath made them ſeruaunts vnto man.</hi> And if hee hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined the Angels to helpe vs, much more other creatures to ſerue vs in our néede, to cheriſh and to comfort vs, to féede vs, and to cloath vs. Let vs looke vppon other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and conſider the heauens, the moone and the ſtarres which God hath ordeined, and it ſhall make vs to ſay in ioy and comfort. <hi>O Lord what is man, that thou art ſo mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of him?</hi> The Sun as it chéereth all other creatures, ſo is it a great comfort vnto man, and it is a pleaſure vnto him to beholde the faire beautie thereof, and giueth him cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in all his worke and labour. The Moone hath her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers obſeruations, and great profit, which is the ſchoole mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe vnto the huſbandman, to teach him to ſowe and to plant, and a chiefe director vnto the Sea-man, to order his voyages and nauigations by Sea, to marke the ebbe and the flow by the new and the change. And with the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the Sea-man, we may yet learne further, with great delight and ſinguler helpe that God hath ſent. Sée how the ſea doth ſwell in waues and riſe in mountaines, and roare as it were for diſcontentment, that it cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflow the face of the earth. For by the courſe of nature, the earth ſhould be vnder and the water aboue. For the water is a lighter element then the earth, neither could the earth auoyd the maſtery of the ſea, were it not that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order were taken, and that God had ſet the ſea his boundes, as if he had ſaid; Here ſhalt thou ſtaie, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7821:72"/>
breake thy proude and ſwelling waues. They goe vp ſaith the Pſalme, as high as the hilles, and would faine bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the mountaines, they goe downe to the vallies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, euen vnto the place which thou haſt appointed for them. Thou haſt ſet them their boundes which they ſhall not paſſe, neither returne againe to couer the earth. Aſke them which venture vppon the ſea, who ſée the workes of the Lord, and his wonders in the deepe, and they will tell thée that they are now carried vp ſo high, that they thinke themſelues in the heauens aboue, and by and by they fall downe into the déepe, as if the waters ſhould be their graue; and no maruell that their ſoule melteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way becauſe of the trouble, and that they are at their wittes endes. The ſea hath his boundes ſet, that man might haue his dwelling, and this is Gods fauourable appointment. Who not onely abateth the force of the ſea, but alſo maketh it nauigable, to giue him reſt at home, and to bring him treaſures from farre. Yet is there an other matter well neare as ſtraunge as this, to ſée howe God ordereth all thinges, fit and conuenient for the habitation and dwelling of man. For as GOD gaue a decrée vnto the Sea and Waters to giue man roome, and not to hinder his dwelling, ſo alſo hath he laide his commaundement vppon the wilde beaſtes, and incloſed them within the deſartes and waſte places, as it were, ſetting vnto them alſo, their boundes, which they ſhall not paſſe. So that although they roare after their praie, and goe raunging about to deuoure, yet they ſhall roare and raunge, and rage no further, then their compaſſe and the deſart, vnleſſe God for a puniſhment vnto men, doo giue them further leaue, as I haue ſhewed you before. Theſe cruell creatures, they come not where man hath his dwelling, but only ſuch creatures as are for his vſe, and for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maintenance of his life. The hornet is in the wood, the bée in the garden, the lion &amp; the bear are in the deſart, kine &amp; horſes at thy doore and in thy ſtable; wolues
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7821:73"/>
farre away, and ſhéepe about thée; wilde beaſts are in deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late places, that man may be at reſt and in quiet. A mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt proofe of Gods ordinaunce herein, is ſet downe in the Pſal. 104. <hi>Thou makeſt darkeneſſe ô Lord, that it may be night, wherein all the beaſts of the forreſt do mone; The ſun ariſeth, and they get them away togither, and lay them down in their dennes. Then man goeth forth to his worke and to his labour, vntill the euening.</hi> The wilde beaſtes ſaith the Prophet do mone, but he maketh no further mention but of the forreſt. And that we néed not feare their rage, he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the night, when man taketh his reſt and his doores are ſhut vpon him. And for a further aſſurance of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious care ouer man, he ſaith, that aſſoone as the Sun riſeth, they get them away; which could not come to paſſe, vnleſſe God had ſo wrought it. God hath ordeined the day that man might labour therein, and the night to giue him reſt; he cauſed the foules of the aire, the cattle on the earth, and the fiſhes in the ſea to multiply and increaſe, that man might take thereof for his foode. The bread to ſtreng then him, the wine to cheare his heart, the ſhéepe to cloath him, diuerſe hearbes for medicine &amp; to cure him in his ſicknes. Quarres for ſtone, trées for timber, that men might make them hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and dwelling places, to keep them from the feruent heat in ſommer, and in the winter from pinching colde, from ſtorms and tempeſts. In a word, all things to comfort him, all things to cheare him, all things to reioyce him. When God had thus created all things for man, the earth to walk in, the beaſts to feede and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>loath him, all things elſe for his vſe and profit, yet was man as it were all in a wildernes, he ſawe no creatur? fit and conuenient to kéep him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; yea when God himſelf had taken a view of all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he ſawe no helpe méete for man. The Lord brought all creatures vnto man to giue them names, and as they were all before God, we reade that God found not a helpe méete for <hi>Adam.</hi> And then he ſaid; <hi>It is not good that the man ſhould bee himſelfe alone, I will make him a helpe.</hi>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:7821:73"/>
Therefore the Lord cauſed a heauie ſléepe to fall vpon the man, and he ſlept; and he tooke one of his ribbes and cloſed vp the fleſh in ſtéed thereof. And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made he the woman and brought her to the man, who before, was like an vnperfect building. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God had ſpeciall regard of the increaſe of mankind, yet in the creation of the woman, there is nothing ſo much ſpoken of as that ſhe ſhould bee a helpe. But I would to God that men woulde more regarde Gods ordinaunce, and conſider there withall, what for frailtie of men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. If themſelues bee able to refraine, let them giue god thankes that hath ſo inabled them, and if other haue not the ſame gift with them, there is no cauſe why they ſhould bee deſpiſed and diſdained, if they vſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie appointed, and auoyd the extremitie. Vnleſſe they count whoredome more tollerable then marriage, and that eſtate which the ſpirite of God dooth tearme honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in all degrees of men, to be contemptible in ſome. Which matter neuertheleſſe is ſo warily to bee handled, that we runne not into contempt, through want of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion. It were to be wiſhed ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that all men were as I am, but euery man hath his proper gift of God. And the ſame Apoſtle foretelleth, that in the latter dayes ſuche ſhall ariſe, that ſhall forbid marriage. Yet ſo to teach, to forbid to ſcoffe or diſdaine, hath this marke to accuſe their conſcience in ſo doing, that it is neither honeſt, nor good, nor laudable, but only the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of diuels.</p>

Behold ſaith the prophet <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. this was the iniquitie of <hi>Sodome,</hi> Pride, Fulneſſe of breade, Aboundance of idlenes, nether did ſhe ſtrengthen the hand of the poore and néedie. The better ſort vſe Gods benifits to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, their comforts, and the helpe of others; But in the worſer ſort of people, of whome the world is too full whoſe minds are giuen altogither earthly, fleſhly, and ſenſually, there is no ſuch regard, no ſuch conſideration, but the more wanton and vain they are, the more they think they pleaſe others, euen ſuch as are like them ſelues: Otherwiſe they giue great offence to them that are godlie and well minded, and vertuouſlie diſpoſed, and prouoke gods anger againſt themſelues. Come ſay they, let vs enioy our pleaſures; as though they were borne for nothing elſe, but to eate and drinke, and to play. Let vs fill our ſelues with coſtly wine and ointments. Let vs crowne our ſelues with roſe buds, before they be withered. But to what purpoſe, and what is their minde in ſo doing? Their anſwere is this. Let not the flower of our youth paſſe by vs, and let vs all be partakers of our wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and let vs leaue ſome token of our pleaſure in euery place. For that is our portion ſay they, and this is our lot; and this is the onelie life wée looke to haue. They that ſowe to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reape corruption; and euerlaſting heauineſſe ſhall be theire portion. For howe ſwéete ſo euer they thinke it is, yet bitterneſſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7821:74"/>
ſhall be in the ende. Though GOD haue created many things, as well for delight as neceſſitie, yet they turne them to a wicked delight, as though the diſtemperature were the right vſe. Surfetting and drunkenneſſe, pride, and exceſſe, whoredome and vncleanneſſe, chambering and wantonneſſe, and what not? Being farre from the minde of the holy Apoſtle, <hi>Vſe the worlde as though thou didſt not vſe it.</hi> Let not this delight of the creatures, drawe thée from thy dutie to thy Creator. That which ſhould prouoke thée the more to loue him, let it not be a meane nor any occaſion, that his anger ſhould be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt thée to puniſh thée. The grace of God hath appeared, to teach vs to liue, not onely godly and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, but alſo ſoberly in this preſent worlde, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king not on theſe worldly delightes, but wayting for the comming of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall make our bodies lyke to his glorious bodie, and at his comming, who ſhall take vs togither with him into the heauens. Let no man grudge if hée be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from ſome delightes. For God hath not graunted to euery one alike, and well is it for the poore, if they haue ſufficient to ſatiſfie their neceſſitie, although they alſo be not reſtrained from all the delightes of Gods creatures. Wherein the rich and wealthie, although they haue great liberty, muſt alſo remember, that God hath enioyned them a lawe of ſobrietie, let them looke vpon the wilde beaſtes which haue but their compaſſe, and vpon the mightie wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which haue their boundes.

And let them frame their mindes to the counſell of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Phil. 4. 12. <hi>I can bee abaſed, and I can abound; euerie where in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full, and to bee hungry, and to abounde and haue want; For I haue learned in whatſoeuer ſtate I am, therewith to bee content.</hi>

Vſe a litle well that thou maieſt be partaker of much more, and ſo ſhall heauenly ioyes follow earthly delightes. By theſe things god doth try vs whether we be méet and fit for him, or whether wée will make our ſelues the ſeruauntes and ſlaues of the diuel.

All theſe things are good to the godly, but to the ſinners they are turned into euill, being made culpable and faultie before Gods iudgement ſeate, by reaſon of their abuſing of them.</p>
                     <p>Thus you haue heard how God hath created all things, eſpecially for his glory, ſo alſo that they might ſerue to the health, life, neceſſitie, and pleaſure of man. But more frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with greater conſideration and reſpect to the good of his choſen people, all which are vnto them, as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, miniſters, and meanes, whereby God doing them good, might be honoured and praiſed of them.

Though the Lord would make win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes in the heauen, could it come ſo to paſſe? And he ſaid, Behold thou ſhalt ſee it with thine eyes, but thou ſhalt not eate thereof. And ſo it came vnto him; for the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he died.</q>

                     <p>After that God had created the world and all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures therein, it may not be thought that he left them alone to themſelues, to liue or die, to continue or periſh: although it maie ſéeme ſo to vs, becauſe when god had made his creatures, he reſted. But he did neither ceaſe nor reſt, as men do from theire workes which they haue made, as after the houſe is built the worke man hath no further care; and ſo in all other labours finiſhed by mans hand. Truth it is, that God reſted from making and creating more crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but not from noriſhing and cheriſhing, from gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and guiding the world and all the creatures therein. Whoſe workes are wonderfull, and daily ſéene of them which haue eies to ſée it. Wherein we muſt alſo conſider, howe God bringetth theſe matters to paſſe, moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ordinarily, and by meanes, but ſometimes extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7821:76"/>
and without meanes, as the example ſet downe in this text which I haue reade vnto you doth ſhew. Which<note place="margin">Diuiſion.</note> text deuideth it ſelfe into theſe two parts; whereof the firſt is a propheſie and a declaration of Gods gratious proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by the mouth of the prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>Two meaſures of barley</hi> and ſo forth. In the ſecond part we may conſider the vnbeliefe, diſtruſt, and blaſphemous ſpéech of one of the kings nobles, as alſo the iudgement of God for his vnbeliefe and diſtruſt, and the iuſt punniſhment for his offence in theſe words. <hi>But the prince had aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi> and ſo forth. In this firſt part, not only is ſet downe the prouidence of God in nouriſhing, but his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power and wiſe foreſight, in gouerning and ordering matters as ſéemeth beſt, to the further manifeſtation of his glorie, by his iuſtice and merice, to the good of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for a iuſt puniſhment to the wicked, prophane, and vngodly. How God dooth nouriſh all his creatures, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better bee ſet downe, then by the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid,</hi> in his Pſalmes. <hi>Hee watereth the hils from aboue, the earth is filled with the frute of thy woorkes, hee bringeth foorth graſſe, and maketh the earth to bring out foode.</hi> And leaſt they ſhould die for thirſt, hée alſo prepareth for their néede, for hée ſendeth the ſprings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the riuers, which runne among the hilles. All beaſts of the fielde drinke thereof, and the wilde aſſes quench their thirſt.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, ſpeaking of the infinite and innumerable company of Gods creatures in the Sea, Theſe ſaith hée, wayt all vppon thée, that thou maieſt giue them meate in due ſeaſon. When thou giueſt it them they gather it, and when thou openeſt thy hand they are filled with good. The eyes of all thinges looke vp vnto thée, thou openeſt thine hand, and filleſt all things liuing with plenteouſnes. For hee maketh graſſe to growe vppon the mountaines, which may ſéeme verie ſtraunge, becauſe of the patching heate of the Sunne. For it is ſayd, that the Sunne doth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7821:77"/>
burne the mountaines, ſeuen times more then dooth the heate of a furnace. His plenteouſnes doth farther appeare, in that as it is in the hiſtory of <hi>Iobe,</hi> he not onely maketh the raine to fall vppon thoſe places which are fit for mans dwelling, but euen vppon the wilderneſſe alſo, where no man is. <hi>Iob. 39. 26. 38. <hi>How ſecret is his bleſſing and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand, that he maketh euen the barren ground to yeelde forth paſture.</hi>
                        </hi> As in the ſame Chapter of <hi>Iobe</hi> we reade, that he hath made the aſſe to dwell in ſalt places, that is, in vnfruitfull grounds, whereas in mans reaſon there ſéemes no foode to grow. Many creatures as farre as we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, ſerue to no vſe, and that mightie creatures, which will not be fed with a little, yet God openeth his plentifull hand and they want not; wherby we learne his great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to preſerue, whatſoeuer wonderfully he hath made. We cannot but wonder, how beares and lions, and ſuche deuouring beaſts ſhould be fed, which are as it were vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable. Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wilt thou hunt the praie for the lion, or fill the appetite of the lions whelpes?</hi> Who is it that prepareth for the rauen, when the birds cry vnto God wandring for lacke of meate. The lions roaring after their praie, do ſéeke their meate at God, ſaith the Prophet. Yea when cattle can looke for nothing elſe but drought and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, as in the time of winter, when the earth denieth food, and hath cloſed vp her ſappe within her bowels, and when the graſſe is conſumed with pinching froſtes, and couered with ſtaruing ſnowes; herein alſo, is God ſaid to open his hand and to be plentifull, in that he graunteth them fodder, and maketh the earth in ſommer ſeaſon, to bring foorth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, that in time of néed the cattle may haue inough. But ſome are ſo raſh in their ſpéeches, that they wil impute this ordinary courſe of gods daily prouidence, to a ſecrete kinde of vertue, which God ſay they, hath giuen to euerie thing at his firſt creation. Which reaſon of theirs, howe fond and fooliſh it is, we may perceiue by this, that nothing can long endure without ſuch foode, as commeth by Gods

hand and prouidence. Some of them féeding vpon whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meate, ſome vpon carrion, ſome of graſſe, ſome of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uender, ſome cleauing to ſtones and finding nouriſhment in them, ſome on the ſand of the ſea, and ſome vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

He hath appointed ſome beaſts to be a foode for other, as the aſſe is the lions praie, and diuers ſmal fiſhes are ſwallowed vp of greater. And who is it that can perfectly ſet downe, the diuers ſorts of nouriſhment and foode, which God hath ordained for all his creatures, to the preſeruation of their liues. Which if it had not bene ſo, I meane, if God had not had care of the preſeruation of his creatures, his creation had not laſted but for a moment, and the glory thereof had not reached vnto this time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould it haue continued as it is like to doo, vnto the worldes end. But as God created all things to ſet forth his glory, and next, for the vſe of man, ſo alſo hath he appointed foode to all liuing creatures, that they might miniſter foode vnto man. Wherin we may wel perceiue the gracious and louing care, that God had for man, who before he wold haue him to be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, prouided all things neceſſary for him. Not vnlike to a man here among vs, that louing the friend who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he intendeth to haue with him, and to come vnto him, ere euer that he wil haue him come, maketh all things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that may be either for his pleaſure, or for his neceſſitie, and then ſendeth for him to come, all things thus being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and prepared. Which is not ſo to be vnderſtood, as though God of neceſſitie did &amp; doth ſo prouide for man, but rather of his goodneſſe and of his mercy. For in ſtéed of health, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue ſickneſſe; in ſtéed of plentie, penury and ſcarcitie; in ſteed of wealth &amp; riches, pouertie and miſery. Therfore God through our prouokement, doth ſometime withdrawe his plentifull hand, and in ſtéed of his gracious prouidence, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for a famin &amp; for a drought, vpon man &amp; vpon beaſt, and breaketh the ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7821:78"/>
but yet for ſinne, God taketh his foode away from him. If ye kéepe all my ſtatutes and continue in my feare, ye ſhall eate the good things of the land, if not, I will withdraw my bleſſings, and ſend the contrary, ſaith God by his Prophets. As eſpecially we may read <hi>Deu.</hi> 28. among the reſt of gods bleſſings, If thou ſhalt obey diligently the voice of the Lord thy God, and obſerue &amp; do all his commandements, bleſſed ſhalbe thy baſket &amp; thy dough, thou ſhalt haue plentie, &amp; the Lord ſhall open vnto thée his good treaſure, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauen to giue raine vnto thy land in due ſeaſon. But if thou wilt not obey, curſed ſhall thy baſket be and thy dough, and the Lord ſhall ſhut vp his good treaſure againſt thée, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that is ouer thy head ſhall be braſſe, and ſend downe no rain, and the earth that is vnder thée ſhalbe iron, ſo faſt clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhall yéeld thee no frute nor any increaſe. Thou ſhalt carry out much ſéede into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field, and ſhalt gather but little in, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graſhoppers ſhal deſtroy it. Thou ſhalt plant a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard &amp; dreſſe it, but ſhalt neither drink of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine nor gather the grapes, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wormes ſhal eat it. All thy trées &amp; fruit of thy land, ſhall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graſhopper conſume. God ſhall prepare for thée and ſend thée plentie, but for thy offences, thou ſhalt not be partaker of it, but he wil giue it vnto vermin before thy face, to make thée wonder at his iudgements, and to deſcend into thy ſelf &amp; examine thy own hart &amp; conſcience, that haſt giuen ſuch cauſe. As the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>cap.</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. Sonne of man, when the land ſinneth againſt me, by committing a treſpaſſe, then wil I ſtretch out my hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and wil break the ſtaffe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread therof, and wil ſend famin vpon it, and I wil deſtroy man &amp; beaſt forth of it. For he wil cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauen to ſtaie it ſelf from dewe, &amp; the earth to deny her fruit. And he wil call for a drought vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land, and vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountains, and vpon the corn, &amp; vpon the wine, and vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oyle, vpon all that the ground bringeth foorth, both vpon men &amp; vpon cattle, and vpon all the labour of the hands. And what a grief wil it be, to ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſéeds of corn rot in the earth, and to be chaunged from corne into wéedes. How
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7821:78"/>
gréeuous ſhal it be to heare the dumbe beaſts for to mourn, and to ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heards of cattle to pine away, becauſe they haue no paſture, and the flocks of ſhéepe to be deſtroied for want of fodder. Yea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuers of waters alſo are dried vp, becauſe the fire of the wrath &amp; diſpleaſure of the Lord, ſhal deuoure all. How ſhould a hundreth fall before tenne, vnleſſe God had giuen them vp to the handes of their enemies? And how ſhould Gods prouidence be debarred from man, but that God did ſhorten his hand through their faulte? For when Gods anger is hot againſt men, then doth he cauſe the enemy to beſiege them, and in the diſtreſſe of the ſiege, ſhall they féele the want of gods gratious prouidence. As we reade in the aforeſaid chapter of <hi>Deutronomy.</hi> The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhall beſiege thée in all thy citties, vntill the high and ſtrong walles fall downe, wherin thou truſt eſt. Then ſhall the tender and excéeding daintie man, that loathed common meates, for want of foode eate his owne children; alſo the tender and daintie woman, which wold ſcarce put her foote to the ground, and was fed as it wer with princes delicats, be glad to eate her after burthen, and hunger ſhall ſo byte her, that ſhe ſhall be readie to eate her child before it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered. Which diſtreſſe being foretold, afterward fel out in the daies of wicked king <hi>Ioram.</hi> For his enemies did ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege him &amp; his people, vntil the famine was ſo great, that an aſſes head was at foure ſcore pieces of ſiluer, and that the women did eate their children. Wel therfore might y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king ſay, ſéeing the Lord doth not ſuccour thée, how ſhould I help thée, with the barne or with the wine preſſe? Meaning, that it laie not in him to helpe them to any vittaile. For when God ſhutteth his hand, and withdraweth his prouidence, who can help? When there is plenty, we thinke all things come by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon courſe, but vntil we be pinched with wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we ſhal neuer perceiue gods prouidence, &amp; then we crie to God for foode, and neuer before. For the ſin of man, God tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth plentie into ſcarcitie, and in ſtéed of foode, they finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; yet to comfort the hearts of the godly, when other
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7821:79"/>
are readie to die for famine, they ſhall haue to ſerue their turn. On euery ſide death, famin, miſery, crying &amp; wéeping, and yet God ſhall f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed them, God ſhal prouide for them, and they ſhall be ſo wel prepared, that whatſoeuer fall out, they ſhall be content with Gods viſitation. As the raine falleth in one place and not in an other, ſo ſhall gods bleſſing reach and extend it ſelfe, more to ſome then to other ſome. When there was a famin in the land, <hi>Abraham</hi> had to ſuffice him; ſo alſo fell it out vnto <hi>Izake</hi> his ſonne, when there was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and he a ſtranger in the land, God increaſed him with ſtore. But a far greater proofe of Gods prouidence, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the godly, is ſéen in the example of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the ſonne, and <hi>Iacob</hi> the father, with all his children &amp; poſteritie. For when many lands were ready to ſtarue, they were fed libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as it were from the kings table. So it falleth out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the godly and the wicked, when we thinke of Gods prouidence. <hi>Abraham, Izake,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> haue plentie, when Eſau is almoſt dead, for want of a meſſe of pottage; &amp; when the prodigall ſonne would faine haue filled his belly with the huſkes that the ſwine did eate, but no man gaue them him, nor had pittie on him. The lions do lacke and ſuffer hunger, but they which ſéeke the Lord ſhall want no maner of thing that is good. For the reliefe of the whole citie of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> but eſpecially for the comfort of the godly, did God ſend his Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to tel them of plentie, ſaying; <hi>Two meaſures of barley at a ſhekel, and a meaſure of fine floure ſhall be at a ſhekel, to morrow about this time, in the gate of <hi>Samaria.</hi>
                        </hi> After great ſcarcitie, vpon a ſodaine great plentie, and more ſtore of corne then of money to giue for corne, inough to ſatiſfie them that were moſt hungry, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to ſpare. God neuer ſuffereth his to want long, though for the wickeds ſake, they are ſomewhat reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a ſeaſon. Who by his prouidence is ſo aboundant, that euen the wicked alſo, as the Pſalme ſaith, are filled with his hid treaſures. <hi>Eſau</hi> had rich poſſeſſions, and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> was a great Lorde, and from him came Princes;

The hand of God was opened in moſt liberall ſort vnto the Canaanites; yet therewithall wee muſt vnderſtand, that this laſted but for a time, and alſo to teach vs, that if God be ſo liberall to them, which are without God in the world, how much more carefull will he be ouer them that are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Truſt thou in the Lord and do good, (which two matters are ſure tokens vnto vs, that if we do ſo, Gods prouidence will neuer faile vs) dwell in the land, and thou ſhalt be fed aſſuredly. Delight thy ſelfe in the Lord, and he ſhall giue thée thy hearts deſire. God maketh his Sunne to ariſe on the euill, as well as on the good, and ſendeth raine on the vniuſt, as well as on the iuſt.

And although the wicked be maintained by gods prouidence, and that largely, yet is it eſpecially for this cauſe, to make them without excuſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhall be called to account, becauſe they haue not liued in the feare of God, ſeeing that God delt with them ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly.

Not but that according to their eſtates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, men may vſe delicate fare in a good and godly ſort, but the vnruly nature of man, is rather giuen to exceſſe, then to a meane. And happie is he that can vſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God without offence. Reade the ſcriptures, and for the moſt part you ſhall ſée, where mention is made of dainties, it hath alſo theſe companions; Sinne, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe, Exceſſe and Riot. The Iſraelites they could not be content with Manna which came from heauen, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Angels foode, but wanton they were, and néeds they muſt haue other fare, grudging and murmuring againſt God. They fell a luſting and wept withall, ſaying; Who ſhall giue vs fleſh to eate? We remember the fiſh that we did eate for nought in <hi>Egipt,</hi> the cucumbers and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and the léekes, and the onions, and the garlicke, whereof we had ſuch ſtore as we could wiſh; but now our ſoule is dried away, and we can ſee nothing but this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. Then GOD ſent them quailes, euen daintie fleſh. The ſwéete mouthes of the Sodomites ſtirred vp the fleſh, and enforced the hart &amp; mind to conſent to great filthineſſe, and their bodies were too ready to performe it. Proud they were, and idle, forgetful of God &amp; of themſelues, and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full toward the poore. King <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> as we read in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Daniel, <hi>ca.</hi>
                        </hi> 5. in his exceſſiue feaſting did abound, but euen then alſo, he was carouſing to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubines, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his idol gods of gold &amp; of ſiluer, of braſſe, of iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of wood, and of ſtone: and further, he abuſed the holy veſſels of the temple. The prodigall ſonne, had a dainty tooth, and he muſt ſatiſfie his mind and ſpend till all was gone, and that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He ſpent it in exceſſe and whoredome. The rich man fared daintily, but he had no regard vnto the poore; and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7821:80"/>
not vnto their cries. But what became of theſe dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie people? While the fleſh of the quailes was betwixt the téeth of the Iſraelites, a plague came from God and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a number of them; Fire and brimſtone from heauen burnt vp the Sodomites. The ſame houre that King <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> was feaſting riotouſly and wickedly, he ſawe that with his eyes, that troubled his thoughtes, and made his countenance to change, and his heart to melt, and his knées to beate one againſt an other, for feare and trembling. A heauy matter was ſhewed him, the loſſe of his kingdome, he eſcaped not ſo, but he loſt his life too. After the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſonne had eaten vp his portion of goods, and ſpent all in ſugar and ſauce, then came beggery and miſery, and homely meate, huſkes with ſwine. The riche glutton, whoſe table was furniſhed in his life time to his hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, after his death had hell fire to his meate, but wanted drinke to quench his thirſt withall, and could not get ſo much as a droppe of water to coole his tongue, though he made great intreatie for it. Godlines is great riches, if a man be content with that which God hath caſt vnto him, and by his gratious prouidence hath giuen him to enioy. A ſmall thing ſaith the Prophet, vnto the iuſt man, is better then great riches, to the wicked and mightie: For they are daily fed as with Manna from heauen, and haue ſufficient, when the wicked haue neuer inough, but euer hunger. The wiſe man being deſirous to liue in the feare of God, and being reſolued in a contented mind, deſireth to be fed by Gods prouidence, no farther foorth, then that which ſhould be méete and conuenient for him. <hi>Two things</hi> ſaith he, <hi>haue I required of thee ô Lord, deny me them not before I die. Remoue far from me vanitie and lies; Giue me not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, nor riches, feed me with food conuenient for me, leſt I be full &amp; deny thee, &amp; ſay, Who is the lord? or leſt I be pore &amp; ſteale, &amp; take the name of my God in vaine.</hi> As y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Apoſtle ſpeaketh of them, that are too too deſirous of riches, ſo may I ſpeak of them y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are not content w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods prouidence, but like

wantons call for more. For ſuch diſcontented mindes fall into tentations and ſnares; and into many fooliſh and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome luſtes, which procure their deſtruction. For in ſuch fond deſires; the roote of much euill lieth hid. Wherefore let vs carry the minde that <hi>Iacob</hi> did. <hi>O Lord if thou wilt giue me bread to eate, and cloathes to put on, thou ſhalt be my God, and I will worſhip thee;</hi> and if we haue raiment and foode neceſſary for vs, let vs therewith be content. A li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſerues the turn to a contented mind, and the poore mans children that are fed but with bread and water, are as faire and in as good liking, if not better, then are the rich mens children, that haue choyce of meate at the full. A notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample whereof, we haue in the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fed but with pulſe and water, was fairer and in better liking, then all the children which did eate the portion of the kings meate. It is not the meate, but the bleſſing of God that doth all. For although God hath appointed the bread to be our foode, yet we liue not by bread only as Chriſt teacheth, but by euery word that procéedeth out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of God, and from his ſecret maintenance. In him we liue, we moue, and haue our being. A great deale without gods bleſſing ſhall do vs little good, and his prouidence maketh a little ſuffice, and hath framed and taught nature, ſo to be content. Which goodneſſe of God in bleſſing a little, let vs marke in the eſtate of the rich and the poore. We thinke the poore is not able to liue, becauſe he wanteth worldly helps; ſuch as other doo abound withal, and which they cannot find in their heart to part from, to doo the poore good, although God hath ſo commaunded them, and bleſſed them with ſtore, to this intent that they might be helpfull to the poore, and to thoſe that ſtand in néed. For God hath made the rich and wealthie his ſtewards to diſpoſe his goods. But behold, the poore man in his need and neceſſitie, is either diſdained or deſpiſed, or at leaſt wiſe not comforted of the rich &amp; weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie. Yet God doth not ſo leaue him comfortleſſe, God doth not ſo leaue him without helpe. For the poore that liue in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7821:81"/>
the feare of God, and take an honeſt courſe of liuing to maintaine themſelues, God bleſſeth their labours, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a little to ſtretch farre. Whereas oftentimes, the rich and wealthie, hauing not the feare of God before their eies, and truſting to worldly helpes, and in the meane time, ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otting and ſpending their goods, as though they had moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, they ſoone waſte all and come to nothing, much like the prodigall ſonne, who waſted all to his ſhirt, and at laſt, wanted bread to féede him. <hi>I haue bene yoong</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid,</hi> in his Pſalmes, <hi>and now am old, and yet ſawe I neuer the righteous forſaken, nor their ſeede begging their bread.</hi> Where he putteth a difference betwixt the poore, whereof ſome be ſlothfull, and ſome be painfull. The ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full indéed they begge their bread, becauſe they refuſe to get their liuing by the ſweate of their browes, as God hath commaunded. And againe, God hath laide his curſe vppon them, that they haue the ill will of all people, whereſoeuer they go; and no maruell it is, if God withdraw his helping hand from them. But as for the painful and honeſt that are poore, gods bleſſing is with them, and God miniſtreth vnto them diuers helpes, and giueth them this comfort, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce them withall, and to cheare their hearts, that they ſhall liue in credit, hauing the good will of all, and as we are wont to ſay, in good name and fame. So that we may truly beleeue, the ſaying of the Prophet, That the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are neuer forſaken, but that GOD raiſeth them vp friends, and rather then they ſhall want, féedeth them him ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Although God by his prouidence doth nouriſh all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Praier.</note> and principally man, yet as the lions ſéek their meat at God, and the rauens cry vnto God, ſo ought wee alſo much more to make our praiers vnto God, that he wil giue vs our daily maintenance, and not only ſo, but to take ſome honeſt courſe of life, to get our liuing, and to vſe all other lawfull meanes, warranted and allowed by gods word. There is nothing giuen, but lightly it is requeſted, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7821:82"/>
God maketh vs to ſtand in néed euery day and euery houre, to the intent that we ſhould pray for it. Elſe our Sauiour Chriſt would not haue taught vs to pray, <hi>Giue vs this day our daily bread.</hi> God giueth meate to euery liuing thing, in due ſeaſon; but as the Prophet ſaith, They looke vp vnto to the Lord, they hope and truſt to receiue reliefe at his hands, when they cry they are heard; and when we make our praiers, <hi>Our Father which art in heauen, &amp;c.</hi> then are we made partakers of our deſires. Wherefore they are to be accounted worſe then beaſtes, which will neither o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their lippes, nor lift vp their eyes and hearts to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but looke they ſhould haue maintenance from God, becauſe they heare tell of his prouidence, thinking that God is bounde to relieue them. Although <hi>Iacob</hi> knew that he ſhould be maintained by gods prouidence, yet he made his praier vnto God for foode and raiment. When the poore crieth, the Lord heareth him, and fulfilleth the deſire of them that feare him. So the wiſe man praieth, that God would féede him, and ſupply his wants and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. Euery good thing commeth from God, and if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſo of our maintenance and ſuſtenance, as we cannot otherwiſe chooſe, we muſt looke for it at gods hand, whoſe manner is, to giue nothing without praier, nor refuſe our praiers when we call vnto him, but granteth our requeſts in due time, if ſo be he ſée it méet and conuenient for vs. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our praiers, we muſt adde painfull labour. For we are not created in this world to be idle, but gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that we ſhould get our liuing by the ſweate of our browes. Marke and ſée, whether gods prouidence waite vpon the ſlouthfull, and thou ſhalt ſée his field growne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with nettles and thornes, and himſelfe cloathed with ragges. Is not that belly emptie, whoſe hands refuſe to worke? and doth not winter ſtarue him vp, that will not ſéeke his liuing in the ſommer? Whereas contrariwiſe, the painfull hand plentie, and God giueth good ſucceſſe to their labours, ſo that they are able to helpe others beſides
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7821:82"/>
themſelues. And furthermore, God noteth them out with this marke, that the idle liue in contempt and ſhame, and diſhonour, when they that ſéeke Gods bleſſing by their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, are crowned with credit, and are honored in the gate and open preſence, and are commended of all men. But of this matter, more God willing hereafter. Theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other meanes, hath God knit and ioyned vnto his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, yet not ſo, but that he is able alſo to helpe vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe means, neither are we ſo to put our truſt in them, as though by them we had helpe, &amp; not by gods prouidence. Amongſt other means of maintenance, there is the help of frends, in whom we muſt not ſo repoſe our ſelues, as thogh God did not giue vs our maintenance by them. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Iacob</hi> and his children, being in great diſtreſſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, was to be reléeued by the helpe of his ſonne <hi>Ioſeph</hi> that ſent for him, yet his truſt was vpon Gods prouidence, and therfore he hath principal reſpect therennto, and aſketh counſel of God. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> like a kind and louing child ſent for him, the king of <hi>Egipt</hi> alſo was deſirous y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he ſhould come, but yet he wold not ſet forward, vntil God had aſſured him of his prouidence. In whoſe example, let vs mark and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that whatſoeuer comforts God graunteth vs in this world, friends, children, or princes themſelues, yet let our ankerhold be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord, and none but he. Knowing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> with him theſe comfortes ſhall profit vs, and without him faile vs, as moſt fickle and vncertaine things, euen then, when we would be moſt glad to enioy and haue them. <hi>I, I wil be with thee,</hi> is a word of truſt, and let it euer be looked too of vs. The ſtaie &amp; ſtaffe of all men in their buſineſſe, is the Lord, and none but he. For marke I pray you, how God draweth <hi>Iacobs</hi> eies from looking vpon <hi>Ioſephs</hi> honor &amp; credit in the land, whither now he was going, &amp; from beholding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings fauour &amp; kindneſſe, that had ſo friendly ſent for him; how he withdraweth his hart from truſting in theſe things, vnto himſelfe, and his protection and prouidence, ſaying; <hi>I wil go with thee.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaid, This is thy ſafetie, thy
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7821:83"/>
ſtaie and ſtaffe, that will holde thée from falling, euen my preſence with thée, and my prouidence for thée, not thy ſons power and honour, though it be great, nor yet the kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, though indéed it be very gratious. If by the meanes of friends any thing fall out according to our hearts deſire, let vs giue god the thankes, who hath ſo diſpoſed theire minds toward vs, and hath made them the inſtruments of his bountifulneſſe to helpe vs. To whom alſo we are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our ſelues beholding, and a dutifull minde will not reſt, vntill there be recompence made one way or other, to the vtmoſt of his power. For that good which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, hee will acknowledge god to be the authour, but his bountifull helpers among men he will honour, as it were the Angels and Miniſters of god, ordained for his reliefe and comfort. And that by gods appointment he is bounde vnto them, through whoſe hand and helpe, it pleaſed him to ſhewe foorth, and to powre his benefits vpon him. And yet great is the difference betwixt the helpe of friends and the helpe of god. For man vſeth thus to reaſon, I haue bin good vnto him, and ſtood him inſtéed, therefore he may not grate vppon me any more, and in all equitie and reaſon, he is not further to vrge me, and a man may be too bold of his friends. But our ſwéete and gratious god quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I haue bene good and ſtil wil to continue. To make true the words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet. It is better to put our truſt in god, then to put any truſt in Princes. But becauſe this meane and helpe of friends, hath bene and is often greatly abuſed, to withdraw our hearts and mindes from the vndoubted truſt of gods neuer-failing prouidence, which ought only to be our refuge and ſtaie, aboue all other worldly ſtaies, I minde god willing to ſpeake more here of in the ſecond part of this text. Moſt true it is, that although god doo prouide for vs, yet moſt commonly he vſeth ſo to do by meanes. Notwithſtanding, rather then he will ſuffer his to periſh, he vſeth meanes that are extraordinary and vnlooked for, and ſuch, that vnto vs may well ſéeme very ſtraunge. Who

would think that a rauen a hungry foule, ſhould ſpare from himſelfe, &amp; bring vnto man, yet we read 1. <hi>kin.</hi> 17. 4. that the Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> was fed by rauens.

Nay, God ſaith, <hi>I haue commaunded the rauens to feede thee.</hi> For to ſtrengthen his faith againſt perſecution, God did promiſe to féede him miraculouſly. So likewiſe we reade of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> who being in the lions den, was like to ſtarue for any meat that was broght, yet God had reſpect vnto him in his neceſſitie. For a certain Prophet in <hi>Iewry</hi> called <hi>Abacuc,</hi> hauing made pottage, was going to the field, to bring it to the reapers; but the Angel of the Lord ſaid vnto <hi>Abacuc, <hi>Go carry the meat that thou haſt into</hi> Babilon, <hi>vnto</hi> Daniel, <hi>which is in the lions den.</hi>

                        </hi> Then ſaid <hi>Daniel, <hi>O God thou haſt thought vppon mee, and thou neuer faileſt them that ſeeke thee, and loue thee.</hi>
                        </hi> So <hi>Daniel</hi> aroſe and did eate, and the Angel of the Lord ſet <hi>Abacuc</hi> in his own place againe immediately. The Prophet Ieremiah, being in the dungeon and readie to die for hunger, God thought on him, and made a ſtranger to labour for him, and to ſpeak in his behalfe. For one of the kings Enuches and chiefe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> the blacke Moore, which was in the kings houſe, heard that they had put <hi>Ieremiah</hi> in the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.

The words of the Author are theſe. Now when I call to mind the wonderful workes of God, I cannot paſſe ouer, but tell you, how that after the murther and maſſacre of <hi>Narden,</hi> and the whole towne on a flaming fire, a yoong Lad was ſaued, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of the gates of the towne into a little gardain full of rootes. The father of this boy was murthered, and his mother being rauiſhed, was hanged vp by the armes, of the Tyrantes Spaniards, and when the fire came and tooke holde of her houſe, ſhée beeing tied by the armes, could not get away, ſo that ſhée was burnt in her owne houſe. The yoong Lad, hauing not eaten any thing for the ſpace of thrée whole dayes togither, wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, both for the death of his parents, as alſo by reaſon that he was hungerbit. But God who neuer forſaketh his, ſent him reliefe. For the very ſame night, there came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a wel-fauoured yoong man, in white apparrell, who gaue him whereon to féede, and ſaid.

Wonderfull are Gods woorkes, and infinite are his mercies, and his wayes paſt finding out. Oh what is man, fraile man, wretched and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man, that God ſhould thus regard him, may we well ſay with the Prophet.

To giue thankes for that which is receiued, is a way to helpe vs to more, in time to come; to be thankfull for the old, brings with it a new benefit, and a new good turn.

                     <p>The order of Gods prouidence being thus ſet downe, concerning the maintenance, preſeruation, and foode of all creatures, we may alſo behold how God doth gouerns all things.

The reaſon thereof, and the words of the Chapter, are theſe. <hi>For the Lord had cauſed the Campe of the Aramites, to heare a noyce of charrets; and a noyce of a great army: ſo that they ſaid one to another; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the King of Iſrael, hath hired againſt vs, the Kings of the Hittites, &amp; the kings of the Egyptians to come vpon vs. Wherefore they aroſe and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horſes, and their aſſes, euen the campe as it was, and fled for their liues.</hi> This ſuddaine change, might<note place="margin">A new line.</note> ſéeme to come from fortune or ſome blinde chaunce, yet is it manifeſtly ſet downe, that it was Gods working, and that he onely brought this matter to paſſe. Who is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, not only of plentie and ſcarcitie, but of ſickneſſe and of health, of wealth and pouertie, of warre and peace, of drought and raine, of tempeſts and faire weather, of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reinneſſe and fertilitie. Yea he guideth and gouerneth the hearts of men, and their affections; yea euen their tongues, and all their actions. And that which is more ſtraunge, he hath an eie to the ſmalleſt matters, the haires of our head, the lighting of the ſparrowes vppon the ground; and that which ſéemeth to be but a matter of chance, the ordering of lots in matters of waight, he diſpoſeth them too. Nothing commeth to paſſe by fortune and chance, nothing by deſtiny
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7821:86"/>
or neceſſitie, but all by Gods prouidence and handie worke.</p>
                     <p>And hauing now to intreate of gods gouernment ouer his creatures, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affaires of the world, it is as if I ſhould walke in a wide field, or ſaile in the large ſea. What other men haue thought of gods gouernment, it is baſe and light, but what we are to thinke thereof, let vs daly weigh with déep conſideration. Men of void mindes, haue thought God only to ſit idle in the heauens, and to beholde thoſe things which are done; otherſome, that he moues the world, and all the parts therof, but not that he doth direct the peculiar actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery creature. They wil confeſſe his great power, but they deny his infinit &amp; incomprehenſible and moſt wiſe gouernment in the world, or in the affaires of men, or men themſelues. Some were content to yéeld a little, and they were perſwaded, that he ruled all things in heauen, but as for all things vnder the heauen, they thought were ruled and ordered by fortune &amp; chance. Doubtleſſe God doth rule all matters, and ordereth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes that tend therunto; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they as a ſhip on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea without a gouernor, or as an arrow in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire, which is blowne aſide of euery light wind. But to proue vnto you, that God by his prouidence is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guider &amp; gouernour of all things, it ſéemeth very expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, firſt to remoue all doubts out of your mind concerning fortune and deſtiny, which are too riſe in moſt mens mints and tongues. Which are two great ſtumbling blocks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken out of the way, we ſhal the more cléerly perceiue and certainly know, the vertue and force of gods heauenly<note place="margin">The opinion of fortune re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued.</note> prouidence. This opinion of fortune, hath brought almoſt all the world to fortunate mindes, and vnſtedfaſt hearts, when they thinke that all things runne vpon hap &amp; chance, which are otherwiſe ordered. If a man in his iourney light vpon théeues, and be robd and ſpoild, wherunto will he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his loſſe and his hurt? Are not theſe his words? It was but my ill hap. So if ſailing vpon the ſea, through ſome ſuddaine tempeſt, he make ſhipwrack, or trauelling by the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7821:86"/>
way méete with wilde beaſtes, if he be killed by the fall of ſome houſe or ſome trée, who is it that thinketh of any other cauſe then of fortune, as if the blind were led by the blind, and ſo both fall into the ditch. For fortune is fained to be blind, becauſe fooliſh men ſée not the cauſe of thoſe things that are done; and how can a blind man iudge of colours? If one digging in the earth, finde any treaſure that hath bene hid, or finde a bagge of money, as he is going by the way, or after great ſtormes and tempeſts, hardly eſcape death, and come ſafe into the hauen, then who but ladie Fortune; and fortune is honoured as a Quéene, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a goddeſſe. Of like, ſuch a goddeſſe, as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of, <hi>Vnto the vnknowne God.</hi> So is the true God robbed of his honour, who onely is the authour of weale and woe. Was it a chaunce or Gods appointment, that beares came into the cittie, and deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the children, that mocked the Prophet. Putcaſe, that two neighbours goe to the wood togither, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 5. one heweth wood, and as his hand ſtriketh with the axe, to cut downe the trée, if the head of the axe ſlippe from the helme, and hit his neighbour that hee dieth, was it a chaunce trowe you? The ſcripture and word of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideth this matter, and ſaith; that God hath offred him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 13. God hath diuers puniſhments for ſinne, and his iudgements are moſt iuſt, though they be moſt ſecret, and hid from the eies of men. The field is pitched, two great armies méete togither, the fight endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth long; now one army is readie to haue the vpper hand, and after a while the other, at length ſay we, by good happe that army ouercame. If it be true that this matter fell out by happe, how can the word of God be true, (which without all controuerſitie is the onely truth) which auoucheth the contrary in theſe words. <hi>Prou.</hi> 21. 31. <hi>The horſe is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the battle, but the victorie is of the Lord.</hi> Hee that prepareth himſelfe vnto a long iourney, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no further then to that which is beſore his eyes,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7821:87"/>
and wiſheth that he may haue a lucky iourny, and then al is wel, at leaſt wiſe if it end well. But <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeruant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his maiſters buſineſſe, to ſéek a wife for his maiſters ſonne, praieth to God for a proſperous iourney, and lifteth vp his eies to heauen. Whereas theſe fortuune-folks runne hedlong on, and looke to méet good fortune by the way, much like to him, that ranne after his ſhadow to catch it, when it ranne away from him, as faſt as he followed it. Where ſhal a man think &amp; ſée fortune &amp; chance more, then in drawing of lots, but as we ſhall read, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16. 33. This fortune matter, is ruled by God. <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition therof is of the Lord.</hi> Looke into all waightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which were commited vnto lots, and you ſhall plainly ſée and perceiue gods worke liuely ſet downe. Eſpecially in the hiſtorie of <hi>Ionas</hi> the Prophet, and of <hi>Achan</hi> that ſold the Babyloniſh garment. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7. and of the chooſing of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> vnto the Apoſtleſhip, in which buſineſſe, after they had made their praiers vnto God, that he would ſhew them out the man, whom he had choſen, they committed the matter to lots, and the lot fell on <hi>Matthias.</hi> So you ſée what a follery, the deuiſed ſpéech of fortune is, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thoſe matters which we think to be done by chance, are brought to paſſe by gods appointment. Yet ſome more wiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt, letting paſſe<note place="margin">Deſtinie.</note> all ſpéeches of fortune and chance, haue ſurely thought, and ſtedfaſtly affirmed, that the affaires of men, and men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are ruled by deſtiny. And herehence come thoſe ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; He was borne to this or to that, he was marked to be of this or that condition, his deſtinie was to die by ſuch or ſuch a death. One dares not go ſuch a way for théeues, an other, if he ſée a ſwoorde drawne, thinketh hée ſhall be thruſt through with it: an other feareth to dwell in rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten houſes, leſt by this meanes they ſhould come by their deſtinie; and a thouſand ſuch like feares, doo poſſeſſe their<note place="margin">Multi fata vitantes in fata incide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

his truſt in God, and is not amazed with ſuch vaine feares, and is fully perſwaded, that ſo long as he kéepeth himſelfe in the feare of God and doing well, no euill ſhall come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Contrariwiſe, they that thinke all is diſpatched by deſtinie, feare euery houre leſt they be diſpatched them ſelues, and in ſtéed of a quiet heart and minde, there is nothing but faintneſſe and feare of trembling. What carke and care to defende themſelues and to preuent miſchiefes, and yet all in vaine, if Gods prouidence bee otherwiſe, whereunto we muſt haue ſpeciall regarde in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and endeuours, and ſo to reſt our ſelues contented with Gods will, whatſoeuer falles out. If any bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to lewdeneſſe or any naughtie diſpoſition, if any hurt come, or any gréeuous trouble, or hazard of life, ſurely will they ſay, he was borne vnder an ill Planet, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an vnlucky ſigne. Which indéed is not ſo, but rather Gods puniſhment laide vppon him, who oftentimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ouer ſome to an euill mind, and lets them runne on, that their puniſhment might bee the greater, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth many to their death, by his ſecret and moſt iuſt iudgements. But ſuppoſe that the Plannets and the Starres, the heauenly influences and celeſtiall bodies, doo worke any inclinations in the mindes of men, or foreſhewe ſome gréeuous euents: yet theſe leaude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and fearefull euents, cannot come nigh them, nor touch them, nor hurt them that frame their liues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of Gods word. No better witneſſes in this matter, then they that haue beene more priuie hereunto, then the common ſort. To the proofe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I will ſhewe two examples, or euidences and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. <hi>Socrates</hi> a learned Philoſopher, being iudged by one that was ſkilfull, to be dull, ſenſuall, and incline<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7821:88"/>
to heare him ſay ſo. Nay ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> let his iudgement nothing mooue you. For certainly ſuch a one had I bene, had not the inſtruction of Philoſophy, amended the corrupt inclination of my nature. Well then, if the inſtruction of Philoſophy, may ſo much preuaile, as to alter our mindes and inclinations, much more ſhall the word of God, and the force of his holy ſpirit be effectuall in vs, to the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſo good a purpoſe. The other proofe, to diſprooue all matters of deſtiny, taken out of one of the deſtiny wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is this. Take no notable thing or any great matter in hand, neither begin any long iourny in the houre of <hi>Mars,</hi> if you can by any meanes know when it is. Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that, which daſheth all by his own confeſſion. But ſaith he, who ſo euer put their whole truſt in God, and do guide their liues by the rule of his holy word, (be they neuer ſo ſimple and vnlearned) God will ſo direct them, that they ſhall auoid all ſuch daungers and perillous times. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, the wicked being learned, (yea thogh they know the times) ſhall not haue power to auoid them. As I haue ſéene ſaith he in many, which afterward they did well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, though too late. It is not therefore blinde chaunce, nor heauy deſtiny, but Gods prouidence, which in great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ordereth all things, and bringeth all things to paſſe, and hath the times and ſeaſons, and all plagues and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his hand, to ſend them foorth, or to keep them back. All which he diſpoſeth to the benefit and good of his choſen children, as alſo to the deſtruction of the wicked and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to the greater manifeſtation of his owne glory, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his mercy. <hi>Haman</hi> the <hi>Agagite</hi> as we ſhall reade in the hiſtory of <hi>Eſter,</hi> hated <hi>Mordecay</hi> the Iewe vnto death, the reaſon was onely this, becauſe <hi>Mordecay</hi> bowed not his knée vnto him.

The king is requeſted in the Iewes behalfe, <hi>Mordecay,</hi> his good déed that that hee did for the king, in opening treaſon that was practiſed againſt him, is called to remembraunce, and the cauſe of this pretended murther made manifeſt, that it was onely the mallice that Haman had conceiued againſt <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay</hi> for no matter of waight.

The righteous eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth out of trouble, and the wicked ſhall come in his ſtéed ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Prouerbes. Looke into the ſelfe ſame

hiſtory of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and there ſhal ye read of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> the wife of <hi>Ioachim,</hi> a beautifull, and that which is rare, a chaſte and godly woman alſo. Through her beautie, two wicked Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were inflamed, and hauing gotten time and occaſion, to come priuily into her preſence, néedes ſhe muſt yeeld vnto them, or elſe no way but death. She refuſeth, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her cauſe to God, and crieth out. The wicked Iudges they beare witneſſe againſt her, that ſhe would haue bene naught with a yoong man. And when ſhe was led to death, God raiſed vp the ſpirit of a yoong child, to trie out the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Iudges being founde guiltie, were ſtoned to death, and <hi>Suſanna</hi> deliuered. Was this their deſtinie, or or was it the manifeſtation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſtice of God in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? God knoweth by his wonderfull prouidence, howe to bring the miſchieuous intents of the wicked to naught, turning all to the ſetting forth of his glory, by ſhewing his iuſtice on the one ſort, and declaring his mercy vnto the other, to the comfort of the godly, and to the terrour of the wicked. For as god hath a prouident and fatherly care ouer the godly, not only proſpering their eſtate of life by his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold bleſſings, and helping them in all their neceſſities; but furthermore aſſwaging their griefes, and eaſing &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting them in all their miſeries &amp; diſtreſſes: ſo alſo hath he a ſtroke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> practiſes of the wicked, that they ſhalbe able to do no more, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he hath determined, &amp; ſhall giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue to do. As our Sauior Chriſt anſwered <hi>Pilat,</hi> when he ſaid vnto him, Anſwereſt thou nothing? knoweſt thou not, that I haue power to looſe thée, and power to condemne thée? Ieſus anſwered &amp; ſaid vnto him, Thou couldeſt haue no power, vnleſſe it were giuen thée fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue. Which alſo is confirmed by the ſayings of the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 28. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the death of Chriſt. Doubtleſſe ſay they, againſt thy holy ſon Ieſus, whom thou haddeſt annointed, both <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> with the gentiles and people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> gathered themſelues togither, to doo; whatſoeuer thy hand and thy counſell had determined before to be done. Diuers
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7821:89"/>
waies hath god to reſtraine the mallice of the wicked, and to breake their mightie purpoſes. Sometimes he caſteth a dumpe into their mindes, and taketh away their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; ſometimes although their ſences be freſh, and and their mindes currant, and marnellous readie, as a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the praie, yet before they come to the déede, God ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth a feare into their hearts, or ſtoppeth them ſome way or other, that they cannot do as they would. Sometimes god giueth them leaue a degrée further, as to beginne and to put their miſchiefe in practiſe, but before their matters come to an ende, he croſſeth all, and they ſtand amazed, to thinke what was done. <hi>Abſolon</hi> he laieth his plot, to put his father out of his kingdom, and vſeth flattering means, and ſtealeth away the hearts of the people, his minde was currant, and his ſences freſh, he taketh counſell of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it goeth forward. The trumpet is blowne, and the people rebelliouſly are vp in armes againſt their lawfull king, the matter beginneth now to be ſet on foote, <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> he giues miſchéeuous counſell, but god turneth it into fooliſhneſſe; The armies méete, but vpon a ſodain, <hi>Abſolon</hi> and his army are diſcomfited and diſmaid, and before he can come to the victory, and to enioy his fathers kingdome and his crowne, he hangeth vpon an oake, being caught by the long locks and haire of his head, and thus taken vp betwéen the heauen and the earth, he hangeth, til <hi>Ioab</hi> one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chief captaines of his fathers army came, and thruſt thrée darts through him, and diſpatched him of his life. King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> he cannot away with the people of god that dwell in his land, hee is affraide they will be more mightie than his people. He taketh vppon him to be wiſe, and to ſtop the increaſe of the people, and giueth commandement to ſlaie the men children, the midwiues fearing god, they kéepe them aliue. Yea he that afterwarde was moſte againſt him, was preſerued aliue by his owne daughter, and daintily kept, as one of the kings ſtocke, ſo long as he would himſelfe.</p>

                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:7821:90"/>When this deuice failed, he laieth vpon them ſore oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and gréeuous burthens, and taſkes them to the death, belike to make them flie his land. God taketh ſuch order in their behalfe, that they ſhould depart out of his kingdome. I know not how, but the king will not giue them leaue, and when they were going out, he purſued after them to deſtroy them, and in the puſuit loſt his owne life, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moe of his people. The hiſtories of <hi>France</hi> can tell, that although their perſecuting king, be in his complet harnes, and in his roialtie ſhall ſhew his valour among his friends and ſubiects, yet while he is Iuſting, a ſplinter of <hi>Momo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> his ſpeare, ſhall enter, as the arrow did betwéene the ioynts of king <hi>Ahabs</hi> Brigandine, that he died, and ſhall ſtrike him through the holes of his eyes, into the braines, that he dieth, euen a little before that he ioyeth, to ſée and beholde the death of a fewe poore Chriſtians. Marke and wonder, at the eſtate of our Soueraigne, and gratious Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom pray we, that God may long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue among vs, to his glory, and our comfort. What mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and miſchiefe againſt her? One curſeth, an other reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to performe treachery, the third, in a holy and deuout minde, counteth it religion, to murther her, whome God hath annointed, and eſtabliſhed to rule and gouerne vs. Poyſoning aſſaied, Sorcery and witchcraft put in practiſe. She taketh them to be her friends, which are come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch her of her life. Either in her countenance, they ſée Gods preſence, or in their hearts is a fainting feare, that the dagge charged, cannot ſhoote off, or the poinado readie, can do no hurt. No counſell and no practiſe, againſt Gods care, and prouidence, and mercy. What hindered king <hi>Saul</hi> from killing <hi>Dauid,</hi> who afterward was king in his place? Or who hindered the deſperate Iewes from killing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle S. <hi>Paul?</hi> Or how came it to paſſe, that <hi>Eſau</hi> after he had purpoſed the death of his brother <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet in ſtéed of crueltie, ſhewed him mercy? There was no other cauſe, but Gods working and his prouidence, who defendeth his with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7821:90"/>
a ſtretched out arme, and turneth his wrath againſt the reſt. Where alſo we may learne in the examples before remembred, that none méete ſooner with harme, then they that moſt meant it, they dig a pit for others, and fall into it themſelues, they thinke it ſhall not ſo fall out, but they know not what Gods power is, and how he bringeth his matters to paſſe. Which he ſo doth, that we may haue iuſt cauſe to ſay, Doubtleſſe there is a God that iudgeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, and ruleth all things by his prouidence. And the more that we may wonder hereat, and glorifie God, certain it is, that Gods prouidence doth then ſhine moſt brightly, when our matters are moſt troubleſome; yet how troubleſome ſoeuer they be, God directeth all to a good end, to the good of the one, and the puniſhment of the other; to his iuſtice and to his mercy. The thunder ſéemes to ſhake the heauens, the lightning to burne vp all; raine and haile, and tempeſtes, make men agaſt, and yet in a moment God taketh away all, and maketh the weather faire. The bluſtering windes are vp, the ſea rageth &amp; riſeth vp in mountains, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ouerflow the earth, and ſuddainly there is no ſuch matter, but a ſtill and quiet calme. The <hi>Aramites,</hi> they come in multitudes, and readie to ſwallow vp the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> nothing before them, but feare and hunger, and famine, and death, and ſuddainly againe, ſafetie, and plentie, and peace. As if one in a dreame had ſéene dreadfull things, as to bee ſlaine by his enemies, or deuoured of wild beaſts, or drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſea, but when he was awake, it was nothing ſo. In all extremities: God helpeth his by his gratious and mightie prouidence; yet ſo, that he will haue vs alſo to put<note place="margin">

If God do offer vs meanes of deliuerance, let vs not neglect them, or be ſlow to vſe them, if he foreſheweth daungers, let vs not ruſh into them, as king <hi>Ioas</hi> did, who although he were a godly king, yet through his raſh enterpriſe loſt his life;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7821:91"/>
who being foretold what would fall out, yet fooliſhly would aduenture. God hath graunted vnto men, the reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and alſo to conſult of doubtfull and daungerous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which God vſeth diuerſly to the performance of his prouidence. Let wiſedome and care, and diligence be vſed, and commit thy wiſedome and counſels to Gods will, and then God will further our cauſes; Be flothfull and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and ſée what will follow, euen dangers and miſchiefs before thou art aware.</p>
                     <p>Yet let vs wade further into the affaires of men, and ſearch theſe two waightie points, concerning proſperitie and aduerſitie. What greater proſperitie can there be in the world, then is the proſperitie of a king? yet nothing is more ruled by gods prouidence then this matter: as though God had eſpeciall care of them, that ſhould repreſent his owne perſon. Wherein he hath alwaies regard to them, who walke vprightly to kéepe his ſtatutes, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. As it was ſaid vnto <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> Meditate in the lawe of the Lord, that thou maieſt obſerue and do according to all that is written therein. For then ſhalt thou make thy way proſperous, and then ſhalt thou haue good ſucceſſe, and I will be with thée, ſaith the Lord, whither ſo euer thou goeſt. Which is confirmed by the example of king <hi>Dauid,</hi> who gaue his ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> this charge. Take héede to the charge of the Lord thy God, to walke in his waies, and kéep his ſtatutes, and his commandements, and his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and his teſtimonies, as it is written in the lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that thou maieſt proſper in all that thou doeſt, and in euery thing whereto thou turneſt thée. That the Lord may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his word, which he ſpake vnto me ſaying; If thy ſons take héed to their way, that they walke before me in truth, with all their hearts, and with all their ſoules, thou ſhalt not ſaid he, want one of the poſteritie, to ſit vpon the throne of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Nowe marke howe the prouidence of God doth worke vpon this foundation, and vpon this ground. King <hi>Saul</hi> when hee thought vppon no ſuch matter, was made
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7821:91"/>
king by Gods appointment, for God commanded the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to annoint him king, who ſo continued, vntill he diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beied Gods commandement. And then he that annointed him, was the meſſenger to tell him, that God had diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of his kingdome. Becauſe (ſaith he) thou haſt caſt away the word of the Lord, the Lord hath caſt away thée, that thou ſhalt not be king ouer <hi>Iſrael</hi> any more. The Lord this day hath rent the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from thée, and hath giuen it to thy neighbour, that is better then thou. The like we reade of king <hi>Salomon,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who had ſo large a promiſe, with this excription, if he kept the couenant of God. <hi>Salomon</hi> brake it, and in ſtéed of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the true God, he followed after other Gods, euen ſtrange Gods, and ſuch as his godly father knewe not. Wherefore the Lord ſaid vnto <hi>Salomon; Foraſmuch as this is done of thee, and thou haſt not kept my couenant and my ſtatutes which I commanded thee, I wil ſurely rent the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from thee, and will giue it to thy ſeruaunt.</hi> As we reade, 1. <hi>K. 11. 26. <hi>Ieroboam Salomons</hi>

                        </gap>uerſcer of his works, lifted vp his hand againſt the king; and this was the cauſe. The Prophet <hi>Ahijah</hi> met with <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> and the prophet caught his garment and rent it in twelue péeces, and bid him take ten péeces vnto himſelfe, ſignifying that the moſt part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome ſhould be his; becauſe his maiſter king <hi>Salomon,</hi> did moſt worſhip God aright, but fell away from him by idolatry. And that the prouidence of God may be more manifeſt; we reade, that after <hi>Ieroboam</hi> rebelled againſt <hi>Salomons</hi> ſon which ſate in his throne, I ſay this young and vnwiſe king, he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth a greater power to go againſt him. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God came vnto <hi>Shemaiah</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man of God, ſaying; Thus ſaith the Lord: Ye ſhal not go vp, nor fight againſt your brethren, the children of Iſrael. Returne euery man to his houſe. For this thing is done by me. They obeied therefore the word of the Lord, &amp; returned and departed. And ſo was <hi>Ierochoam</hi> king <hi>Salomons</hi> ſeruant, eſtabliſhed in the crowne, and the

true heire put by, becauſe God gaue it him. <hi>Salomon</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would haue ſlaine him, <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the ſonne would haue executed him as a traitor, and yet behold, it was not in their power: which only worke of Gods prouidence, in diſpoſing of kingdomes, <hi>Adonijah Salomons</hi> brother conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, it made him relent from his purpoſe of ſéeking the crowne by mightie meanes, as otherwiſe he would haue done, if it had not béen for that. For this is his confeſſion, putting forth a requeſt vnto <hi>Salomons</hi> mother. 1. <hi>K. 2. 15. <hi>Thou knoweſt</hi>
                        </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the kingdome was mine, and that all Iſrael ſet their faces on me, in token of their fauour and conſent that I ſhould raigne, becauſe I was the elder brother; howbeit the kingdome is turned away and is my brothers; for it came vnto him by the Lord.</hi> God (ſaith king <hi>Nabuchodonozor</hi> that heathen king) according to his will worketh in the inhabitantes of the earth, and none can ſtay his hand, nor ſay vnto him; what doeſt thou? Whom he wil he ſetteth vp, and whom he will he throweth downe. And according to that which I haue ſaid, <hi>Daniel</hi> told that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked king <hi>Belſhaſar,</hi> the ſonne of proud <hi>Nabuchodonozor,</hi> (when he ſent for him to reade the writing that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and to giue the interpretation) O king, heare ſaith the prophet. The moſt high gaue vnto <hi>Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi> thy father a kingdome, and maieſtie, and honour, and glory, and ſo forth. Thou haſt ſéene Gods iudgementes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy father, and yet thou haſt not humbled thy heart, though thou kneweſt all theſe thinges: but haſt lift thy ſelfe vp againſt the Lord of heauen, and haſt praiſed thy gods of ſiluer and thy gods of gold, and haſt not glorified God, in whoſe hand thy breath is, and all thy waies. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath God ſent thée this writing, to ſhew thée, that thy kingdome is at an end, &amp; that he hath giuen it vnto others. As the ſame prophet ſpeaketh elſwhere. God chaungeth the times and ſeaſons, he taketh away kinges, and ſetteth vp kinges. Next to a kingdome, to be in great honour, credite and eſtimation, is like the proſperitie of a king. Some are
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7821:92"/>
exalted vnto honour, and ſome are left in diſgrace. Studie and deuice with thy ſelfe, how it ſhould come to paſſe. And when thou haſt done, thy reaſon cannot attaine it.

And as he debaſeth the wicked, ſo he lifteth vp them that feare him, and cauſeth the vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, (that is, them that are thought vnworthie in the ſight of the world,) to weare the crowne.

It is a ſmall thing in the ſight of God, ſuddainly to make a poore man rich, as it is moſt eaſie to him, to bring ragges to rodes, and ſhackles and fetters to the ſcepter and to the crowne.

Yet as the mightie ſhip is turned about with a ſmall rudder, and the fierce horſe is guided by the bridle, ſo dooth God ouermaſter their purpoſes, and diſpoſeth all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure.

is ſtirred vp againſt the Iews, and he is diſpoſed to execute his vengeance, and the wicked that ſhall performe it, are called by the name of hammers, axes, ſawes, and alſo may well be ſayd to bee whippes and ſcourges: and héere in this place, they are compared to a rodde and to a ſtaffe. O <hi>Aſhur,</hi> the rodde of my wrathe, and the ſtaffe in their handes is mine indignation. I will ſend him to a diſſembling nation, and I will giue him a charge againſt the people of my wrath, to take the ſpoyle, and to take the praie, and to treade them vnderféete, lyke the mire in the ſtréete. In that which followeth, marke their miſchéeuous intents. But he thinketh not ſo, neither doth his heart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeme it ſo, but hée imagineth to deſtroy and to cut off, not a fewe nations.

But to let you vnderſtand, that God hath as it were a bridle in his hand, to reſtraine them, the Prophet vſeth theſe wordes. <hi>Shall the axe boaſte it ſelfe againſt him that heweth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with? Or ſhall the ſawe exalt it ſelfe againſt him that moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it? When they ſhake the rodde, ſhall it magnifie it ſelfe againſt them that take it vp?

Then God ſent them comfort by a Prophet, ſaying; <hi>Feare not, for the battaile is not yours, but Gods; Stand ſtill, mooue not, and beholde the ſaluation of the Lorde.</hi> And now behold Gods prouidence, and his worke. When they of <hi>Iudah</hi> beganne to ſhout, and to praiſe God for his great mercy, then the Lorde layd ambuſhments againſt the children of <hi>Ammon, Moab,</hi> and mount <hi>Seir,</hi> to flaie and to deſtroy them. And this is ſtraunge, when they had made an end of the inhabitants of <hi>Seir,</hi> euery one helped to deſtroy an other, till there was not a man left, as though euery one had ſworne his owne death. The lyke example is in the booke of <hi>Iudges, cap.</hi> 7.

When mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries come, we can ſée Gods prouidence, God graunt that when hee ſendeth proſperitie, wee may acknowledge his goodneſſe and not be forgetfull.</p>
                     <p>So much for the gouernment of God in the affaires of men. Now let vs conſider the ſame in men themſelues. A ſect of Philoſophers called <hi>Pripatetickes,</hi> although perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture they did acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouidence of God in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, yet rather then they would haue man ſubiect to the ſame, would deny that there were any prouidence at al, as if it gréeued them that gods prouidence ſhould ſtretch further then their owne reaſon did lead them. And ſo long as they tried the matter by their owne wits, as if they had fought with their owne ſhaddowes, they were confirmed in their vntruthes, but if they had but opened the booke of God, they ſhould full well haue perceiued, howe man himſelfe is ſubiect to Gods prouidence. <hi>O Lord</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah, Chap. 10. 23. <hi>I knowe that the way of man is not in himſelfe, neither is it in man to direct his ſteps.</hi>
                        </hi> That which men conceiue in their mindes, God doth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily and after an vnſcarchable ſort direct, as ſtandeth beſt to his lyking. As wée reade in the Prouerbes of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Chapter 20. 24. The ſteppes of a man are ruled by the Lord, howe then can a man vnderſtand his owne way? What part in man more ſecret vnto him, then his heart? Or if there bee any thing in his owne power and will, is it not the heart? Yet God aboue which made and faſhioned all hearts, and is the onely ſearcher of the heart, and knoweth the meaning thereof, he is alſo the ruler of the heart. As fierce as a lyon, ſo is the kings heart, and he thinketh with himſelfe, who can either controll him or commaund him. King <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> his proud heart, God did abaſe. And king <hi>Salomon</hi> hath vttered it, that the kings heart is in the hand of the Lorde, as the riuers of waters, hee turneth it whither ſoeuer it pleaſeth him.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7821:95"/>
When Quéen <hi>Heſtor</hi> came in the preſence of her Lord and King <hi>Ahaſhneroſh,</hi> he was very terrible, and he lift vp his face, that ſhone with maieſtie, and looked fiercely vpon her, therefore the Quéene fell downe and was pale and faint. Neuertheleſſe God turned the kings heart and mind, that he became gentle, &amp; being carefull, leaped out of his throne and tooke her in his armes, til ſhe came to her ſelfe againe, and comforted her with louing words. The ſame God that turned this kings heart to gentlenes, hardned king <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi> heart, who was cruell vnto his dying day. King <hi>Saul</hi> when he was newly made king, moſt of the people deſpiſed him, ſaue a fewe onely, whoſe hearts the Lord had touched to go after him. Pſal. 105. 25. He turned the hearts of the enemies of his people to hate them, which God vſeth as a meane for their deliuerance. Which thing the godly well knowing, that God hath mens hearts in his hand, pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, that he would giue them fauour in the ſight of them, which had led them away captiue. <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> 11. 19. 20. There was no cittie that made peace with the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaue thoſe Himites that inhabited <hi>Gibeon,</hi> all other they tooke by battell. For it come of the Lord; to harden their hearts, that they ſhould come againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> in battell, to the intent that they ſhould deſtroy them vtterly, and ſhewe them no mercy. Which thing the harlot Rahab con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed vnto the ſpies, praying mercy for her, and for her friends. I know ſaith he, that the Lord hath giuen you the land, and that the feare of you is fallen vpon vs, and that all the inhabitants of the lande fainte becauſe of you. For as a good courage is the Lords gift, as we ſée in the example of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> whome God willed to be ſtrong and of a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; ſo for a puniſhment of them that feare not God, he promiſeth to giue them a trembling heart; and a ſorrowfull minde. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. 36. If ye walke ſtubburnly againſt me, I will giue you ouer into your enemies hands, and I will ſend a faintneſſe into your hearts, in the land of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the ſound of a leafe ſhaken ſhall chaſe you, and ye
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7821:96"/>
ſhall flie as flying from a ſword, and ſhall fall, no man pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing you. Againe, when they walke obediently, ſee how the Lord turneth the hearts of others to do them good. The example of king <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is notable, I ſpeake not of that king that did oppreſſe the Iſraelites, but of that king, that did relieue them. For when the tidings of the méeting of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his brethren came to <hi>Pharaohs eare,</hi> the text ſaith, it pleaſed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> well and his ſeruants. Where we ſée the power of God toward his, as to giue them fauoure in the hearts, eares and eyes, of any mortall man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, whoſe miniſtery it ſhall pleaſe him to vſe, to their reliefe, comfort, and countenance. He ruleth poore and rich, meane and mightie, to his childrens comfort, when he will. The Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> that Gods fauour may be towardes him, prayeth, that God will create in him a new heart, and for a ſtony and rebellious, prayeth that hee would giue him a tender and a repenting heart. As God ruleth the heart, ſo he ordereth the affections, that come from the heart. <hi>Eſau</hi> had a wrathfull minde, and his purpoſe was to ſlaie his brother; but when his brother and hée met, beholde howe all was turned; imbracing, and kiſſing, and teares, and tender loue. Who wrought this louing affection in <hi>Eſau,</hi> and chaunged his hatred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good will? Onely the Lord, euen the mightie and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Lorde, he hath wiped murther and wrath out of his mouth and heart, out of his minde and purpoſe, and out of his might and power. When the Midianites and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites came againſt <hi>Gedeon,</hi> they were neighbours and friends, but before they departed, euery one ſlew an other. For God had ſo determined. In conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof, who woulde not tremble at Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to thinke howe God worketh in the hearts of the wicked, bringing that to paſſe that he will, and yet for all that, plaguing and deſtroying the wicked according to their deſerts. Affections, paſſions, and diſpoſitions, are ruled by God. If he liſt hee cauſeth friendſhip and loue,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7821:96"/>
if he pleaſe, he ſetteth diſlike and hatred, and euer well in reſpect of hun. It is the iuſtice of God, that they who haue ioyned in lyking one of an others counſell and déed, further then God allowed, ſhould as farre iarre as euer they were friends. Surely ſuch ende will vngodly friendſhip haue. Daily we ſée it, that they that haue bene beſt accounted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt hated. So able is God, to ſet ſuch at variance amongſt themſelues, and to continue their iarre to his good pleaſure. <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herode,</hi> of a long time had bene enemies, but about Chriſt his death they became friendes. What was it elſe, but Gods dooing? to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten that, which hée had determined to bring to paſſe, for the redemption of mankinde. The ordering of mens affections, preuaileth ſo farre to the good of the godly, that as it is in the Prouerbes, chapter 16. 7. When the waies of a man pleaſe the Lord, he will make his very enemies at peace with him. Further, it is to be conſidered, that god not onely ruleth the heart, and the affections of the heart, but euen the tongue alſo. Prouerbes 16. 1. The prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart are in man, but the anſwere of the toong is of the Lorde. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaking of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chéeuous intents of the wicked, and howe they are reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſaith the Pſalme 64. 8. 9. Their owne tongue ſhall make them fal, inſomuch, that who ſo ſeeth them, ſhal laugh them to ſcorne. And all men that ſée it ſhall ſay; This hath god done: for they ſhall perceiue, that it is his worke. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the tongues of the godly God directeth, as ſhall be beſt for their behoofe. The nature of man is fearefull how to anſwere, being called before mightie men. But to the comfort of them that feare God, it is written, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 17.

As the Prophet praieth that God would open his eyes to ſée the wonders of his lawe, ſo alſo he praieth that he would turne away his eyes, that they ſhould not behold vanitie. The diſciples that iournied to Emaus, their eyes were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that they could not know Chriſt. The eyes are ſhut, and ſomtimes alſo the eares are dull and cloſed vp. <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 27. King <hi>Saul</hi> had a ſpeare in his hand, to throw at <hi>Dauid</hi> but his hand was reſtrained. The heart, the affections, the tongue, the eyes, eares, and hands, yea the whole body, God ruleth, as is manifeſt in the example of <hi>Saul</hi> the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who after became <hi>Paul</hi> a bleſſed Apoſtle. Yet before his conuerſion and happie change, he breathed out threatnings and ſlaughter, and made haſt to procure trouble to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

                     <p>I haue bene hitherto tedious, becauſe the treatiſe is ſo comfortable, in the reſt I purpoſe to be briefe, to ſatiſfie thy minde. The maruellous prouidence of God, and his moſt ſecret handy worke, being now declared, concerning the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of men, as alſo men themſelues; there remaineth behinde, a matter as waightie as the reſt, and that is this. That if all things be ruled by Gods prouidence, and by an euen and vpright hand; Firſt how falleth it out, that ſuch miſchieuous and wicked déeds are committed in the world as we daily ſée. Secondly, why do the wicked and vngodly flouriſh, when as they that ſerue God moſt are put to the worſt, and that they finde their affaires to goe croſſe and ourethwart. Which matters, although they be ſo waighty, I cannot now ſtand vpon, but muſt referre the handling of them, vntill ſome other time, onely at this time I minde God willing to touch them, and briefly to ſet downe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. God hath ſo created the world, that he is ſtill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour thereof, in ſuch ſort, that nothing is done or can come to paſſe, but by his counſell and prouidence.

And howſoeuer it be, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſeth and gouerneth all, with a ſecret bridle, and after ſo wonderfull a faſhion, that we muſt reuerence it, with all humilitie, becauſe we are not able to comprehend it. Vaine therefore are their ſpéeches, and moſt vngodly, which ſéeme to defend their wicked déeds by gods prouidence, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the diuine maieſtie (which is nothing but holineſſe it ſelfe) in a maner culpable with them. Whoſe ſpéeches are after this ſort. Some deſperate ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And thus they ſhroud their hainous ſinnes, vnder gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and thinke they deſerue no otherwiſe but well. They thinke they did performe gods will, but they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their owne wicked will. Gods commaundements are to the contrary, whereunto we ought to haue reſpect. And if any thing be committed otherwiſe then may ſtand with the ſame, it cannot be without offence, much more will the ſin abound, if it be expreſly and purpoſely againſt gods will and commandement. God bringeth about his purpoſe and decrée diuers waies, according to his infinit wiſedome; which herein ſheweth it ſelfe ſo much the more, that he can vſe the workes of the wicked well, though the wicked be fouly in fault. Théeues and murtherers, and ſuch malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, are often inſtruments of gods iuſtice, vnawares to them; yet neuertheleſſe there can be no lawfull excuſe for their notorious miſchiefes. For if the lawe of God be not ſufficient, their owne conſcience will reprooue them, and cry vengeance againſt them. In God there is no euill, in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7821:98"/>
men there is nothing but euil. The Sunne by his heate, cauſeth a ſtinking ſmell to come forth of a carkaſſe, when as there is no ſuch thing in the Sunne but in the carkaſſe. So God vſeth the miſchieuous déeds of the wicked, as may ſtand moſt with his glory, though it tende to their great condemnation, vnleſſe the mercy of god bee the greater. It lieth in Gods power to reſtraine them, but oftentimes he giueth them vp to themſelues. As our Sauiour Chriſt confeſſed, when he was taken of his malicious and cruell enemies. This is your very houre ſaith he, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darkeneſſe. For then God gaue libertie to Sathan and his miniſters, to execute their rage. In their mindes was malice, miſchiefe, and crueltie, but the glorious purpoſe of God, was to giue his onely ſonne for the redemption of the world. God deteſteth ſinne, but yet turneth the wickedneſſe of ſinners, as ſéemeth beſt to him, oftentimes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of themſelues, to make his iuſtice more famous. The wicked cannot chooſe but doo ill, God is not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of their wickedneſſe; but at what time, or againſt whome their miſchiefe ſhall breake foorth and take place, that is in Gods hand, and in his moſt mightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</p>
                     <p>As for the other matter in queſtion, why the wicked flouriſh, and the godly are oppreſſed. Although it be ſo, let vs not therefore deny Gods prouidence. Many tyraunts there are and wicked men in the world, and as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, the tabernacles of robbers doo proſper, and they are in ſafetie that prouoke God; They raigne and rage, and their power is great: yet who knoweth, what God mindeth to worke by them? Amongſt the reſt, this ſéemeth to be one cauſe, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minds of the godly might be proued. There are many excellent vertues which lie hid in them, which without this meanes cannot be knowne. Eſpecially in the time of martirdom and perſecution, when they ſhalbe tried and put to death by tyrants, for the profeſſion of gods truth. And although otherwiſe alſo they ſuffer many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs

Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe god hath ſuch great care ouer the godly, that euen the angels of his wrath which are farre more mightie then ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and all the oppreſſors of the earth, euen thoſe wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full angels ſhall not hurt them. As we reade <hi>Reue. cap.</hi> 7. 2. Thoſe angels, to whome power was giuen to hurt the earth and the ſea, they were charged, not to hurt the earth, neither the ſea, vntill the ſeruants of god were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their foreheads. Thoſe houſes in <hi>Egipt</hi> whoſe doore poſtes were ſprinckeled with blood, were ſafe from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying angell, when other houſes not ſo marked, were ſtroken with death.

                     <p>The laſt part of this text, which I haue read vnto you, doth ſhewe out the puniſhment of God, and their il ſucceſſe which diſtruſt Gods prouidence. Which is made manifeſt in the iudgement of God againſt the prince, that gaue out ſuch diſtruſtfull words, and ſaid; Though the Lord would make windows in the heauen, could it come ſo to paſſe? But it was anſwered him, that he ſhould ſée great plentie, but ſhould not eate thereof. And ſo it caine vnto him, for the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he died. For in this fearefull example, let vs cenſider of what eſtate, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and calling, this man was, that ſaid; If God would open the windowes of heauen, could it be ſo? By his eſtate and degrée, he was a prince, and one of the kings chiefeſt nobles, and ſuch a one, on whome the king leaned, who ſhould haue glorified God moſt. For the higher the degrée is, the more doth God require at their hands. If a meane man had ſpoken it, there had not bene ſo great cauſe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, neither ſhould it haue bene ſo much regarded. But ſéeing a noble man, and that a prince did ſpeake it, eueris one thought ſo too, and all their hearts no doubt were daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. According as we reade, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 13. 24. When the rich man ſpeaketh, euery one holdeth his toong, and looke what he ſaith, they praiſe vnto the cloudes. But if the poore man ſpeake, they ſay; What fellow is this? and though he ſpeak wiſely, yet can it haue no place. When king <hi>Abimelech,</hi> had told his ſeruants waightie matters, they were all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraied. The worde of a magiſtrate, ſuperior, and high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, pearce farre, and that which they ſpeake, is in euery mans mouth. It preuaileth much among the lower ſort, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to drawe them to good, or to mooue them to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

as we ſée in a realme, when the heades and chiefe doers of any rebellion be cut off and put to death, the reſt, their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is gone, and all things are quiet. If the ſinne and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be notorious in perſons of account, God ſometimes maketh their puniſhment to be notorious alſo; that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be remembred, and that there may be a feare in euery mans heart, that they do not the lyke. How highly his, and all ſuch ſpéeches, do offend and diſpleaſe God, we ſée by his example.</p>
                     <p>Farre be it therefore, that any ſhould diſtruſt gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, either in féeding and nouriſhing vs, as wee ſay; there is no mouth but God ſendes meate, and as it is in the Pſalme; <hi>He giueth foode to all fleſh, for his mercy endureth for euer.</hi> Or that we ſhould diſtruſt him and his power, in other matters whatſoeuer; for god is aboue all, and ruleth all. But yet the nature of man is too diſtruſtfull, and lightly none do put their truſt in god, but they that know gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and are fully perſwaded thereof. And yet to ſée how backward men be, that euen the very beſt haue bene found faultie herein, as <hi>Moſes</hi> an excellent prophet, and one that ſaw gods wonders and his miracles; the diſciples alſo that were continually in Chriſt his preſence, and did ſo often ſée his mightie and ſtraunge working. When the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> murmured for want of fleſh, and were deſtrous to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie their luſt, and not their hunger; God ſpake vnto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and told him, that the people ſhould not eate fleſh a day or two, or fiue, or ten, or twentie, but a whole moneth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it came out at their noſthrils. God heard them &amp; gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their requeſt; But how? in his anger, as the words doo import which follow.

Shal the ſhéep and the béeues be ſlain for them to finde them, either ſhall all the fiſh of the ſea be gathered togither for them, to ſuffice them? And the Lord ſaid to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Is the Lordes hand ſhortned?

Two hundreth peniwoorth of bread are not ſufficient for them, that euery man may take a little; And <hi>Andrew</hi> an other of his diſciples ſayd; There is a Lad which hath fiue barly loaues and two fiſhes, But what are they among ſo many? And Ieſus ſaid, <hi>Make the people ſit downe;</hi> and he gaue thanks &amp; brake. The men y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſat down, wer in nomber about fiue thouſand, and they had all inough &amp; left.

He ſmote the ſtony rocke indéed, but can he giue bread alſo, or prouide fleſh for his people? When the Lord heard this, he was wroth. I will adde one example more, concerning the prouidence of

god, in the gouernment of the affaires of men. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not ſo wonderfull, as the hearts of men are fearfull, and their mindes diſtruſtfull. God had promiſed to giue vnto his people the lande of <hi>Canaanites,</hi> to poſſeſſe and to inherite, but before they had ouercome it, god willed <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that one of euery Tribe ſhould goe to eſpie and ſearch the land. Theſe ſpies they knew for a certaintie, that by gods promiſe they ſhould poſſeſſe the lande, and yet when they came backe, there was nothing but diſtruſtful ſpéeches in their mouthes. The land ſay they, floweth with milke and hony, and is plentiful of all gods gooneſſe; neuertheleſſe the people be ſtrong that dwell in the land, and the citties are walled and excéeding great, and moreouer we ſawe the ſonnes of <hi>Anake</hi> there. And we be not able to go vp againſt the people, for they are ſtronger then we. It is a land that eateth vp the inhabitaunts thereof; (for the giants y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dwelt there were ſo cruel, that they ſpoyled &amp; killed one another; and thoſe alſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> came to them) all the people y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we ſaw in it, are men of great ſtature; for there we ſawe giants the ſons of <hi>Anake,</hi> which come of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> giants, ſo that we ſéemed in our ſight like graſhoppers, and ſo we were in their ſight. They did not thus only bring vp an euil report and diſtruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but alſo made all the peoples hearts to ſaint, ſo that they cried and wept, and wiſhed they were dead, and ſayd; Wherefore now hath the Lord brought vs into this land, to fall vpon the ſword? Our wiues &amp; our children ſhall be a pray. And they ſaid one to an other; let vs make a captaine and returne into <hi>Egipt.</hi> All theſe examples, are to prooue, not onely howe wée are giuen to diſtruſt, but alſo that it is a great offence againſt GOD, and that they that haue bene faultie herein, haue ſmarted for it.

The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had bread inough, nay they had hony out of the ſtone, and oyle out of the hard rock, yet they thought y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> God was not able to giue them fleſh. But they had triall thereof, to their coſt. For God cauſed that they had fleſh as thick as duſt, and &amp; feathered foules like as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſand of the ſea, and that in ſuch plentie, that they were al aweary of it. But now commeth ſoure ſauce to their ſwéete meate. When the Lord heard their grudging and diſtruſt, he was wrath. So the fire was kindled in <hi>Iacob,</hi> and there came vp heauy diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe they beléeued not in God, and put not their truſt in his helpe. While they were chewing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meat, the wrath of the Lord was kindeled, and the people were conſumed with an excéeding great plague, and the choſen men, and the chiefeſt of account in all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were ſmitten downe. And yet for all this they ſinned ſtill, and beléeued not Gods wondrous workes. Therefore their dayes did he conſume in vanitie, and their yeares in trouble, and ſoone and haſtily they periſhed, as though they had not bene. Laſt of all, let vs ſée the heauy iudgements of God vpon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable ſpies, and vppon the diſtruſtfull people. The ſpies that brought vp that vile ſlaunder, died by a plague before the Lord, and the people whoſe harts fell away from God through their ill report, God pronounced, that for their diſobedience, they ſhould wander in the wilderneſſe fortie yeares. Certainly ſaith the Lorde, I wil do ſo to all this wicked faint-harted and vnbeléeuing company. For in this wilderneſſe they ſhalbe conſumed all of them, from twenty

yeare old and aboue that haue murmured, and there they ſhall die and leaue their carkaſſes. Furthermore ſaith the Lord, <hi>Your children which you ſaid ſhould be a praie, them will I bring in, and they ſhall know the land; the land which you through your diſtruſtfull hearts haue refuſed.

did oftentimes not ſhewe his power and helpe, becauſe of the incredulitie, diſtruſt, and vnbeliefe of the people. The ſiſter of <hi>Lazarus</hi> beginning to diſtruſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 46. Chriſt ſtept vnto her, and ſtaied her vnbeliefe, ſaying; <hi>Did not I ſay vnto thee, that if thou didſt beleeue thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of God?</hi> Was it onely ſpoken for her ſake, and not for ours alſo, who are as readye to offend God by diſtruſt, as ſhe was? Yes doubtleſſe this is Gods watch-word vnto vs. <hi>Beleeue and do not diſtruſt.</hi> Haue I not ſaid vnto thée onely, beléeue; and ſo ſhall we be partakers of our wantes and deſires. For who euer truſted in God and founde not comfort? It is only our diſtruſt and vnbeliefe and nothing elſe, that kéepes good thinges from vs. And if we be fully perſwaded of Gods prouidence, as it is moſt méete and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for vs, eſpecially if we will haue all things go well with vs, all diſtruſt muſt néeds go away, as miſtie fogges and vapours vaniſh when the Sunne ariſeth. Which if we be not reſolued to do, we ſhall altogither depend vpon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, and wauer with the winde, and commit our ſelues and all our affaires as heathen people do, for want of the knowledge of God, to fortune and chaunce. And here by the oppoſition and contrarietie of fortune, deſtinie, and Gods prouidence, we may plainly ſée from whence comes all diſtruſt and feare. If we thinke that we are ruled and our whole eſtate ordered by fortune and deſtiny, then ſhall we be affraide to go out of our houſes, for feare of méeting a madde dogge, or ſome other hurtfull beaſt, or leaſt a tile ſhould fall from the houſe and daſh out our braines, or wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in our garden leſt we tread vpon ſome toade, or ſome adder or ſnake do winde about our legges; If we ſaile on the ſea, rockes and ſandes, and windes, and tempeſts, and pirates; if thou ſtaieſt at home, thy houſe may bee burnt, and theeues in the night may put thée in danger of thy life. Let vs come a little nearer, how many ſickneſſes to bring thée to thy death; ſuch a one euery houre thinks on phiſick, and if he do take phiſicke, he is affraid it will deſtroy him,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7821:102"/>
and bring him to his graue; in a word, euery minute of an houre a new mind. And ſo betwixt doubt, fear, and hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt good ſucceſſe &amp; il ſucceſſe, they liue &amp; linger out a faint and languiſhing life. And when they by their warineſſe and héede taking, to auoyd all hurts and miſeries, none ſooner light vpon them then they, and none more frée from them, then they taht leaſt feare and commit themſelues and their affaires to god. The godly and reſolued minde, in reſpect of them that are fearefully and fortunately minded, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate aboue the other in happineſſe doth excell; his dayes are more chearfull, and his life of longer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance. There is no more liuely an example of a fearefull and fortunate minde, then in a conetous man, and ſuch a one as thinks to bring about all things by his owne wiſedom and foreſight: whoſe mindes are ſo intangled with doubts, that their ſléep, nay almoſt their life goes from them. For when they haue entred into ſuch cares, they cannot ſo ſoone be rid of them, but at and abroad, in company and alone, day and night, ſuch matters runne in their heads, as though they were borne to endure ſuch miſeries. They are affraide of hinderances and loſſes, of ouerthwart &amp; croſſe dealing; ſuch and ſo many be their enemies which lie in wait to plucke them. Some with friendly words deſirous to borrow, whome they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well deny, and then they thinke they ſhall neuer ſee that againe. They will prenent that matter, and laie out their mony vpon a piece of land, and although they play loth to depart, yet a doubt comes into their mindes of faſt or looſe, and if they looſe they are euen halfe vndone. What if their title ſhuld not be good, or their euidences vnſkilfully made, mens heades bee ſo full of ſubtilties: So after they haue bought it and paide for it, they haue a wipe, and all is gone, and peraduenture their mends in their hands. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comes thought and care, which they haue taken to the heart, and makes an end of their life, and they are gone. He purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for his ſonne, if he ſhould be a waſter or leaud liuer, as good neuer laie downe the mony, or if by wrong and iniury
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7821:103"/>
he ſhould be defeated and put out of all, better well ſpared then ſo ſpent. One care ouertake an other til night comes, and then they muſter, as thick as flies in the aire, or motes in the Sun. When they late them down in their beds, their hearts and mindes ſtand vp, and refuſe to beare the bodie company. Either they thinke vpon their goods at home, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, corne, and ſuch like chaffer, or their cattle in the field, or their money that lieth in other mens hands. They deuiſe where they may light vpon a good bargaine, and how they may compaſſe it, they are affraid ſome wil go betwixt them and home, and know not whom they may truſt, the world is ſo full of craft. Such kind of people I may well terme to be night-walkers and down-liegers, who haue giuen their names to fortune, and haue either forgotten, or will not vouchſafe to looke vpon Gods prouidence: Which would bring them great eaſe &amp; contentment of mind, and rid them of theſe infinit cares, which otherwiſe they are ſubiect vnto and cannot auoid, if their liues laie on it. An other ſort there are ſomewhat more eaſed of care, but yet diſtruſtful of gods prouidence; ſuch are they, who if their friends were dead and gone, thinke they are vtterly vndone. Little remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, or at leaſtwiſe not conſidering that of the Prophet; <hi>Though my father and mother forſake me, the Lord taketh me vp; And though I had no friends, yet Gods helpe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all friends.</hi> Againe, happie were I wil ſome ſay, if ſuch a man of honour and worſhip were my friend, or if I had the fauour of ſuch a rich and wealthie man, I might haue ſome helpe of maintenance from him, and I ſhould be ſure whatſoeuer fel out that he would ſtand me in ſteed; he wold ſée me take no wrong; he would ſpeake for me, and ſpende his mony in my behalfe; he would not refuſe me, if I or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friend of mine ſtood in néede of him. Mens mindes be changeable, and friends be deceitfull, and nothing ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine as to truſt in man. I ſpeake not againſt them that are carefull to procure friendes in all good ſort, but fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> a man to put his whole ſtaie and truſt in friends, is not only
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7821:103"/>
an offence to God, but ſometimes, yea and oftentimes it ſo falleth out, that it is but a vaine helpe, and as a broken ſtaffe. How fled <hi>Iobes</hi> friends from him in his miſery? In proſperitie a friend cannot bee vnknowne, for then they flocke as doues to a houſe, but in aduerſitie the number is verie ſmall, euen as one ſwallow which cannot make a ſummer. <hi>Prou.</hi> 19. 7. The friends of the poore will depart from him, though he be inſtant with words to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from them, yet will they yeeld none. Who wil vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to looke vppon him that is in neede and in aduerſitie? lightly a mans very friend will then forſake him.</p>
                     <p>There is an other diſtruſt, as faultie as the former, as when a man is carefull more then néedes, and ſo penſiue that it weares him away. That care which is in a meaſure and agréeable to Gods will, is to be commended, as when men trauaile painfully to get their liuing in that vocation wherein God hath placed them; but otherwiſe it is to be reprooued. For by that care, we grow greatly into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of Gods gratious prouidence; which diſtruſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt doth much ſpeake againſt. <hi>Which of you</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by taking care, can adde one cubit vnto his ſtature? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſoules of the heauen, they ſow not, neither do they reape nor carry into the barnes, yet your heauenly father fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them.</hi> It is written in the lawe of <hi>Moſes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muſſel the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corn.</hi>
                        </hi> Dooth God take care for oxen? Or ſaith hee it not for our ſakes: Doubtleſſe it is written for our ſakes. For God in making the lawe, had principall reſpect vnto men. But if thou wouldeſt faine knowe how thou maiſt auoyd this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, our Sauiour Chriſt doth alſo inſtruct thée, ſaying; <hi>Take no thought,</hi> that is, take no thought more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, in extraordinary &amp; vnmeaſurable ſort. If thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt haue God to ſerue thy turne, and ſhew thée the meanes of thy maintenance and reliefe; his counſell is, firſt to ſéeke the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe: that is, how to ſerue and pleaſe him. And then behold all theſe things
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7821:104"/>
ſhall be miniſtred and caſt vnto thée: ſo that thou ſhalt not haue any ſuch great cauſe to care, but that thou maiſt well diſburthen thy ſelfe, and caſt all thy extraordinary care vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God. And in ſo dooing, <hi>Caſt all your care vpon God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and he will care for you.</hi> Who will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them that are comfortleſſe, and prouide for them that ſtand in néede. That olde and godly <hi>Tobit</hi> may be our example, who hauing had often triall hereof, ſpake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to his ſonne, and with a ſtedfaſt mind in GOD, <hi>Feare not</hi> ſaith he, <hi>foraſmuch as wee are made poore, for thou haſt many things, if thou feare God and flie from ſin, and doo the thing which is acceptable in his fight.</hi> So that in what want and diſtreſſe ſo euer wee bee, let vs not breake foorth into diſcontend ſpéeches, but togither with painfull indeuoure, let vs make our moſte heartie and earneſt requeſts vnto God our Father, who in due time will performe that which wée pray vnto him for, if he ſée that it bee profitable for vs. Matters greatly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for, and as it were vnpoſſible, dooth God worke for them and in their behalfe, who put their whole truſt and confidence in him. For either hée will raiſe them friendes of ſtraungers, or make yea ſometimes their verie enemies to take pittie and compaſſion on them, and to doo them ſome good, or take away the wicked, that the godly may enioy their great wealth and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. And who can recken vp the meanes that God hath in ſtore? For alaſſe what a miſerable caſe were it, if a man ſhould bee left to himſelfe deſtitute and forlorne. Let vs looke backe to our childhood and infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and we ſhall be aſſured of comfort. For before that God woulde haue anie of vs to liue and breathe in this world, we ſée that hée prouided parents and friends, and nurſes, and houſes, and comforts, and whatſoeuer might<note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> be néedfull for vs. And therefore from our cradle to our graue, ſuch helpes cannot want, if we loue and ſerue him. Marke Gods care for other creatures; If he giue foode to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7821:104"/>
the aſſe in drie and barreine groundes; If in due ſeaſon be ſatiſfie the rauens, when they cry and call to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pincht with hunger; If he ſuffer not the roaring li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to want, that is ready to ſtarue; (for although they haue inough to day, yet know they not what ſhall be their foode to morrow, or where to haue it before God ſend it) If he ſhewed vnto <hi>Hagar</hi> and to her childe (being readie to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for thirſt in the wilderneſſe) a well of water, when ſhe thought no other but preſent death; If hee cloath the lily with royall array, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is caſt into the ouen, that is to ſay, a thing in a manner of no account: Howe much more will hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for mankinde, who hath created all thinges for their vſe, profit, and comfort. The earth is the Lords, and all that therein is, and they that liue in his feare ſhall not want, where euer they be. <hi>The Lord is my ſhepheard</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>and therefore can I lacke nothing.</hi> As <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaide; <hi>The Lord is mercifull to me, and therefore I haue all thinges; Hee ſhall feede me in a greene paſture, and leade mee foorth by the waters of comfort.

The full perſwaſion whereof, is alſo a ſtaffe and a ſtaie vnto vs, to auoyd all iniury and hurt. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in the example of his owne perſon, dooth greatly comfort vs. <hi>The Lorde is my helpe, I will not feare what man can do vnto me, the Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom then ſhall I be affraid? When the wicked (euen my enemies and my foes) came vpon me to eate vp my fleſh, they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fell. Though an hoſte of men were laide againſt me, yet ſhall not my heart be affraied, and though there roſe vp warre againſt me, yet will I put my truſt in him. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I walke in the ſhaddowe of death, and looke euerie
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7821:105"/>
houre to looſe my life, yet I am reſolued in comfort &amp; truſt, committing my life and all my affaires into thy hand.</hi> Walk vprightly, and ſet God alwaies before thy eyes, and there ſhall no euill happen vnto thée, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. Pſalme 91. Thou ſhalt not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide for any terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day, nor for the peſtilence that walketh in the darkneſſe, nor for the ſickneſſe that deſtroteth in the noone day. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſhall fall beſide thée, and tenne thouſande at thy right hand, but it ſhal not come nigh thée, becauſe thou haſt made the Lord thy ſhield and thy buckler, thou ſhalt be as deare vnto him as the apple of his eye, and he ſhall carry thee as the Eagle doth carry her yoong ones vpon her wings, and be as carefull for thee as the henne is ouer her chickens. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way then with fortune and deſtiny, which is the feare of heathen people, and leaue them to bee puniſhed and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by ſuch péeuiſh gods, and let vs which know the trus God, being taught by his word, and who haue learned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, referre all to Gods prouidence. What if there be diuerſe hainous matters practiſed in the world? What if the mightie oppreſſe the poore, and the wicked the godly? Yet we knowe that there is a God in heauen that ſeeth all and iudgeth all, and in due time will call all men to their accounts, and although God do ſuffer them vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in this world, yet they ſhall ſurely paie for it in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the meane time, let vs reuerently thinke of gods workes, who ruleth all well, though we knowe not how, and it be altogither hid from vs. And who is it that dare aſke account at Gods handes? whoſe power is neuer idle, but what euer fall out, he ordereth it as ſéemeth good vnto him, and without his decrée ſhall nothing come to paſſe. Great is our diſcomfort, and we are intangled in much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery for want of the knowledge of Gods prouidence; the full truſt whereof, when it hath taken déepe roote in our hearts, come good ſucceſſe or ill ſucceſſe, our hearts are well at reſt. And this maketh vs to be of a quiet, contented, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7821:105"/>
patient mind in all aduerſitie &amp; trouble, as alſo to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in proſperitie, and in all the courſe of our liues there ſhall appeare a calme, although the tempeſtes be vp. And ſo much the more is our comfort, becauſe we are aſſured, that God is our louing father, farre paſſing the loue of any earthly father, and therefore will follow vs with conſtant good will. And becauſe he is alſo God Almightie, he holdeth all creatures in his power, ſo that without his pleaſure, they are not able not only to doo any thing, but not ſo much as to ſtirre. For they that oppreſſe and do wrong, are by the bridle of Gods prouidence brought into order, to conſider that they haue no other power to moue themſelues or to do any thing, but as they are directed of God: Who appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth euill men as roddes, to what purpoſe ſo euer he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good, neither haue they any power of themſelues to hurt; but contrariwiſe, we haue ſufficient helpe in God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their and all other harmes, whatſoeuer. Why ſhould ſuch ſpéeches be vttered through a weake and faint minde, as to ſay; If God would open the windowes of heauen, could it be ſo? Or elſe to ſay the like ſpeech, This is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be brought to paſſe. For with God ſhall nothing be impoſſible. The Lords hand is not ſhortned, but ſtretched out to doo vs good; yea doubtleſſe he wil open the windowes of heauen, to powre downe his bleſſings vpon vs, if we doo not deſerue the contrary.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, (crauing pardon that I haue bene ſo long) let me ſay vnto you, as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians; O Corinthians, our mouth is open vnto you, our heart is made large. Ye are not kept ſtraight in vs, but you are kept ſtraight in your owne bowels.</hi> Gods hand is open, and his bountifulneſſe is vnſearchable, God is not ſtraight to vs, but we are ſtraight vnto our ſelues. God is of power to helpe, and right readie he is, becauſe his mercy endureth for euer. Let vs not be ſo backward, as not to aſke and pray for it, and to vſe all meanes that are lawfull. For God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by meanes, and ſildome by miracles. Let vs not be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7821:106"/>
impatient and diſtruſtfull, neither in any caſe giue foorth vngodly and blaſphemous ſpéeches, auoyding all meanes to procure Gods anger, and committing our ſelues wholly to his mercy and fatherly care in all our neceſſities. And God open our eyes, as he did open the eyes of <hi>Hagar, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> maid, that ſo we may alwaies depend and waite vpon his enduring and bountifull prouidence. To God the father, God the ſonne, and God the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> to pull downe the high ſtomackes of the people, to whome he was ſent, doth not doubt to call them ſo, repeating it often in their eares that they might remember it. <hi>O earth, earth, heare the word of the Lord.</hi> Which thing that godly <hi>Abraham</hi> well remembring, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and of his owne accord confeſſeth, when he made his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt vnto God for <hi>Sodome. <hi>Behold ſaith he, now I haue begunne to ſpeake vnto my Lorde, I am but duſt and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes.</hi>
                        </hi> Fewe there be that thinke ſo, and more, fewe that will acknowledge it.

They neuer looke downe to the earth from whence they came, nor conſider the graue wherunto they muſt go; Duſt and aſhes, earth and wormes meate. To conſider that we came of the duſt, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable to bring vs to humilitie, and to knowe our ſelues, but alſo to put vs in minde of our latter ende, that we may be the better prepared vnto God, and learne to deny our ſelues, and forſake the world. Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked ſhall I returne to my

firſt mould, to the wombe of all things, that is the earth. Duſt was my firſt creation, and duſt ſhall be my latter end and my diſſolution. And yet it is woorth the marking, to ſée howe GOD dooth ſet foorth his glorie héerein, that that creature which hee made of duſt and earth, ſhould haue continued for euer and neuer died, if the ſame crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had continued in his obedience, and truly performed that which hée moſte eaſily had commaunded. Although man was created of the duſt in his firſt beginning, yet God cauſed him to increaſe and multiply by naturall ſeed, and by lawfull matrimony. Wherein alſo Gods worke is daily wonderfull and miraculous; For although the parentes doo their indeuoure, yet it is God that frameth the childe in the wombe of the mother, by his mightie power, neither dooth that matter alwaies come to paſſe after a naturall ſort. For monſters oftentimes come from women, not by the meanes of the parentes, but God hath ſo ordeaned it, that they ſhould bee tokens of his iudgementes. And that the childe in the wombe is the worke of God, let vs ſearch it out in his word. The wiſe man vttereth it in this ſort. <hi>In my mothers wombe was I faſhioned, to be fleſh in tenne moneths; <hi>Wisedome</hi>

Yet if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt to haue this matter more plainly ſhewed thée, turne to the tenth chapter of <hi>Iob,</hi> and reade his words which are theſe, directing his ſpeech vnto God. <hi>Haſt thou not powred me out as milke, and turned me to curddes like cheeſe? thou haſt cloathed mee with skinne and fleſh, and ioyned mee togither with bones and ſinewes. And thou haſt giuen me life and grace, that is reaſon and vnderſtanding, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts, whereby man excelleth all earthly creatures.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God had made man, hee breathed into him the breath of life, and he was a liuing ſoule. Yet this is not ſufficient, to declare how man was created in the image of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his likeneſſe. Which image and likeneſſe is not ſo to be vnderſtood, that either in body or in ſoule, we doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble God himſelfe. For God hath no ſuch forme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, neither doth he conſiſt of fleſh, or blood, or bone. God is a ſpirit, and altogither incomprehenſible. Neither let it any thing at all moue vs ſo to be perſwaded, becauſe wée reade in the ſcripture, The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it; the eyes of the Lorde beholde all things, his eares are open to the praiers of them that feare him; he deliuered his people by a mightie hand, and a ſtretched out arme; he will make his enemies his footeſtoole. Not that God hath either mouth, or eyes, or eares, or hands, or armes, or féete; but it is ſo ſet down in reſpect of our weakneſſe, who are not able to vnderſtand heuenly matters, but by earthly ſimilitudes, and by familiar examples and compariſons. And becauſe we are too earthly minded, therfore by ſuch ſpéeches we are lifted vp to the conſideration of more excellent things. In the ſhape and proportion of mans bodie, he is more comely and beautifull, then all the reſt of gods creatures; yea, and God hath planted in his face and countenance a maieſtie,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7821:108"/>
that all other creatures might feare him and reuerence him: yet we muſt not thinke with our ſelues rudely and groſly, that the image of God conſiſteth in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, lineaments and ſhape of the bodie; although here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath graunted mankind a ſuperioritie, dignitie, and worthineſſe. Becauſe the bodies of all other creatures are framed as it were groueling on the ground, but mankind is made vpright to beholde the heauens, and thoſe things that are aboue the heauens, and that by a ſupernatural and extraordinary ſight. The image of God is not this outward ſhape and proportion, but the inward and moſt vertuous qualities of the ſoule. Wherefore it was no maruell that God ſaid, <hi>Let vs make man,</hi> taking counſell of his wiſdome and power. Concerning all things elſe, that he made, he onely ſaid, <hi>Let it be ſo;</hi> and they were ſo: but hauing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care of mankind, as of a matter more waightie, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more aduicement, and mindeth to ſhewe a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man and woman, to whoſe ſoules he gaue ſo great gifts and graces. Whereby the way, let vs not imagine, that there are more gods then one, becauſe God ſaid, <hi>Let vs make;</hi> but rather the authoritie of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is proued vnto vs, that though there be thrée perſons in the Godhead, yet there is but one God. For as God the father createth, ſo is God the ſonne the wiſedome of all the creation, and from God the holy Ghoſt, procéedeth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of all things. The excellent qualities of the ſoule, and wherein the image of God conſiſteth, is eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſéene in theſe two points, namely, Holineſſe, and<note place="margin">Holineſſe and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> Righteouſneſſe: yet furthermore, they had Frée-will; and by their creation, were immortall and frée from death; and laſt of all, God gaue vnto them this great priviledge, as to haue the ſoueraigntie, the rule and gouernment ouer all his creatures. By which we plainly vnderſtand, that our firſt parents in their time, were frée from all ſinne: which time, is called their time of innocency. In reſpect whereof, Salomon ſearching the nature of man, and comparing the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7821:109"/>
time of his iniquitie, to the time of his innocency, doth thus pronounce of him. Onely loe this haue I found, that God hath made man righteous, but they haue ſought many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, and are gone aſtray through their owne fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo are the cauſe of their owne deſtruction, and are fallen away from the image of God which hee had planted in them. The image of God conſiſteth in the depth of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in the vnmeaſurableneſſe of power, in the infinitneſſe of his goodneſſe and mercy, being perfect holy. perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, doing all things according to the pleaſure of his own will, in whom onely dwelleth life and immortalitie. The moſt of which qualities, if not all, man at the firſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued withall; which were and are in God in the higheſt degrée, but to man they were giuen onely in a meaſure, and in a farre inferiour degrée, and that with a condition, if ſo be hee did continue in the obedience of gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This image of God in our firſt parents, is nothing elſe but the natural conformitie and diſpoſition of the ſoule, and of all the functions, powers, and operations thereof, vnto the lawe of god; whereby fréely, and voluntarily, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth vnto true and perfect holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, that according to that rule, he might ſerue god his Creator, all the dayes of his life. For as god is a ſpirit, ſo will he be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth, and in ſinceriie of heart and minde, hating all manner of counterfait and falſe worſhip, wherunto the nature of man is now too much inclined, and had rather worſhip any thing then god himſelfe. Alſo his dealing to his neighbour ſhould bee inſt and vpright, but ſuch are vaniſhed out of the world, and now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſubtiltie and craft, and wrongfull dealing, and all iniury and oppreſſien practiſed, good hearbes are plucked vp, and nothing is now to be ſéene but wéedes. The holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that god requireth of vs, and according to the which our mindes and hearts were firſt framed, is the holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and true worſhip of god, ioyned with a ſincere loue of god, procéeding from an effectuall faith, in the knowledge
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7821:109"/>
of God his word, and his works. In ſtéed wherof now ratg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth idolatry, the loue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, and worldly luſtes, &amp; the ignorance of God his word is more rife, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of the ſame, and none more accepted, then they that moſt deſpiſe it. The righteouſneſſe alſo which God nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, and wherwith we are inabled, is ſuch a louely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and friendly regard of our neighbours, that we haue care of them as of our ſelues, and wiſh no otherwiſe vnto them then to our ſelues, and doo vnto them as we would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould do vnto vs, and that not outwardly &amp; for a faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but inwardly and from the heart, not in a word onely, but in déed, yea in our thought &amp; ſecrets. This holineſſe and righteouſneſſe was once planted, but neuer came to perfect growth, the good corne is choked vp, and as we ſay, il wéeds grow apace. The dayes of this preſent euill worlde are ſuch, that now the age wherein we liue, may well be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an iron age, and worſe if worſe may be, in reſpect of the firſt age, and the beginning of the worlde, which time, was a golden and precious time, when the hearts and mindes of men, were as fine and pure as golde, or if there bee any thing that may bee ſaide to be more pure. Now is there a vaile caſt ouer our mindes and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, our faces are couered as it were with viſors, and a thicke ſkinne is growne ouer the heart, all ſhame is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and a holie minde and a true and ſound heart, is either very rare, or no where to be founde. Which in the beginning was not ſo. So that now we had néede daily to haue theſe wordes often repeated vnto vs. <hi>Lord who ſhall dwell in thy tabernacle? Who ſhall reſt in thine holy mountaine, and bee receiued into heauen when this life is ended?</hi> None but ſuche as walke vprightly and woorke righteouſneſſe, and that ſpeake the truth from their heart: Who doo not abuſe their tongue in ſlaundering, nor doo any euill to their neighbours, nor receiué and beléeue a falſe report againſt them. In whoſe eyes a vile and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſon is contemned, and who maketh much of them
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7821:110"/>
that feare the Lord, who performeth his oath and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not his mind, although it be to his owne hinderance. Who giue not their money to vſury, ſéeking thereby the vndooing and vtter impoueriſhing of their neighbors; who take no rewarde againſt the innocent, or ſtande againſt them and doo them harme. And they that doo theſe things, and whatſoeuer elſe may ſtand with an vpright conſcience in the feare of God, they ſhall neuer bee mooued, that is, they ſhall not be caſt from Gods preſence, as they ſhall bee that doo the contrary, but their part ſhall bee in the kingdome of heauen, and their ſoules onely ſhall reſt among the bleſſed ſoules. Let vs looke into our firſt creation, and let that be our example and our patterne, and let that be the high way for vs to walke in. In the ſoule of man there are two eſpeciall parts, firſt his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and reaſon; ſecondly, his will and deſire, and all the motions, affections, and inclinations that procéede from the ſame. His vnderſtanding by his creation, was furniſhed with all knowledge méete and conuenient for him, ſo that hée néeded not any to teach him, but God had endued him with that knowledge which might haue well directed him, chiefly in thoſe things that pertaine to the worſhip and ſeruice of God, to his owne ſaluation, and the benefite of his neighbour. And not only his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and reaſon was fraught with all knowledge, but his will alſo and his deſire, was moſt readie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the worſhip of God, his will and deſire was moſt readie to the obedience of Gods commandements. Then by his vnderſtanding hee was able to diſcerne the trueth perfectly, neither did any hereſie, falſe doctrine, falſe religion, idolatrie, ſuperſtition, or vaine opinions, blind his vnderſtanding, or trouble his minde. Then was there no wicked luſtes that did aſſault his will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or that did hinder him from the worſhip and ſeruice of God, but hée was wholly framed and inclined to doo the will of God. His eyes were not filled with luſt, his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7821:110"/>
tongue was not giuen to euil ſlanderous and blaſphemous ſpéeches; his hands were frée from theft; his féete were not ſwift to ſhead blood; drunkenneſſe and gluttonie had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hold on him; fornication and whoredome, had not defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him; neither had any other ſinne that may bee named, power ouer him. But whatſoeuer things were true, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer things were honeſt, whatſoeuer things were iuſt, whatſoeuer things were pure, whatſoeuer things pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to loue and charitie, whatſoeuer things were of good report; if there were any vertue, or if there were any praiſe, on theſe thinges his thoughts were ſetled, to theſe thinges his minde was onely and wholly inclined. And thus you ſee what is ment by holineſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is the chiefeſt part of the image of God, and the eſpeciall conſideration thereof.</p>
                     <p>The next matter which is to be conſidered in the image of God, is, that our firſt parents had Fréewill to performe that which was good, pleaſant, and acceptable in the ſight of God. But they had it in ſuch ſort, that they might fall away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, and when they were fallen away they could not come to it againe, neither was it in their power to recouer it, as alſo their poſteritie could neuer attaine vnto it, although they make great boaſt. They giue forth ſpéeches of winde, and great brags without truth. Indéed it cannot be denied, but that in the time of the innocencie of our firſt parentes, they had Fréewill as we read, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 15. 14. God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counſel, and gaue him his commandements and his precepts, that if he would, he might obſerue the commaundements and teſtifie his good will. He ſet water and fire before him, to ſtretch out his hand vnto which he wold. Before man, was life and death, good and euil, chooſe him whether. But alaſie, in ſtéed of good, he did chooſe euil; in ſtéed of a bleſſing, a curſe; in ſtéed of life, death, By the gift of God it was in his power and Fréewill, to obey y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commandements of God, that ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life hee might bee partaker of the heauenly toyes.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7821:111"/>
Which gift, for want of good héed taking he loſt, and that to the great miſery &amp; ouerthrow of all mankind. This gift and good quallitie did not long continue, but by an vnhappie meanes he did commit euil, and ſo to the end of his life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, inclining rather to euil, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doing good. Once he had Fréewil, and at the time of his creation, when God powred his bleſſings on him in great meaſure, but after that he fell away from God, by diſobeying his commandement, neither he nor his poſteritie had euer after any power to do good of themſelues, but rather the contrary. And then was their Fréewill turned into a ſlauiſh will, becauſe it was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made ſubiect to the power of ſinne, through their owne deſert, and through their owne procurement, and through the craftie working of the diuel; and now all our mindes are ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing ſo much, and delighteth in nothing more then in ill doing. Much like a crooked trée which can neuer grow ſtraight. The firſt man had not this grace of God whereby he ſhould neuer encline to euill, but yet he had that grace, whereby hee might alwayes haue bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued from euill, if hée woulde haue continued therein, but by his Fréewill he forſéeke this grace. And when he had thus wounded himſelfe, hée could not bee healed of himſelfe, and when hée had made himſelfe ſicke, hée could not riſe againe at his pleaſure. But for the better vnderſtanding of this matter, I will laie you downe foure degrées of Fréewill in man, which may ſtand and bee approoued by the ſcriptures and written word of God. The firſt degrée is, that hée had Fréewill, but chaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, that is, GOD left him in the hand of his owne counſell, to ſtande or fall, to continue, or to go aſtray, hée gaue him not withall full ſtrength to abide and to hold out vnto the ende, as he gaue vnto the heauenly Angels, who by his grace continue in well doing. And ſuch was his weakeneſſe, that he did not continue, whereby we may vnderſtand what is in man if he be left vnto himſelfe, and not vpholden by God his grace. The ſecond degrée of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7821:111"/>
Fréewill is to bee conſidered after the fall of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and that may truly be termed a ſlauiſh will, being as I may ſay, frée, and moſt farre from doing well, and moſt vnable thereunto. Becauſe now no fleſh that is men and women, that are begotten of fleſh &amp; blood, can of themſelues do but the workes of the fleſh, that is, all that euil &amp; naught is: as euery one hauing iuſt triall of themſelues knowe, whether thoſe things that they doo are perfectly agréeable to the commandements of God, and ſo their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall be their witneſſe, and thereby they ſhall accuſe and iudge themſelues, that they are farre wide. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the outward ſhewe of the worlde, ſuch workes which they do may ſeeme good and godly, yet being exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the lawe of God, and by the ſtraight rule thereof, we muſt néeds confeſſe and acknowledge, our works to be both naught and euill, ſo farre foorth as they procéede from our ſelues, and are not directed by God: which direction of gods good grace &amp; holy ſpirit, maketh an other difference. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the third degrée of Fréewill is in them, whome God hath called to a better courſe of life, that is, to holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, to vertue and goodneſſe. And yet this power of Fréewill to doo good, is very weake and ſlender, becauſe they cannot ſtand, endure, and continue, they cannot do that which is good without the eſpeciall grace and gift of God. Who alſo are readie to fall away from god, into ſome grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne or other euery houre. As indéed ſuch kinde of people, the diuel doth greatly and mightily, and moſt of all, tempt and prouoke to ſinne. For, for them which are his owne alreadie he takes no thought. They who are thus altered and their mindes chaunged, from following euill waies, which come by the temptations of the diuel, and the ſecret deceits of ſinne that dwelleth within them, and of the world which hath ſo many euill examples to allure them, they ſhould ſoone ſwarue, and eaſily be ouercome, vnleſſe they were ſuſtained and vpholden by the help &amp; aſſiſtance of God. Which helpe, which gift, which grace and aſſiſtance,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7821:112"/>
we obtaine at the hands of God, onely by praier, and by a ſtedfaſt faith. The laſt and the fourth degree of Fréewill, is in the beſt ſort of people, and that after this life in heauen, which ſhall be immutable and without chaunge, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſwaruing. For then ſhal we do nothing, but that which good is, and that with a conſtant minde alwaies to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere and to continue in la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ding and praiſing God, and doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will, as now the Angels of heauen doo. And this may ſuffice concerning Freewill; both that we may know, what power of Fréewil was giuen to man in his firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo what is to be thought, and how we ought to be perſwaded of it.</p>
                     <p>When by mans Fréewill he came to his downefall, then he proued Gods word to be true, <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death;</hi> whereas before he was in the ſtate of life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie. For he was created immortall, with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he had continued in Gods obedience, but being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and careleſſe, he came to his death, and was in the way to hell, when he thought to climbe vp into heauen. When he was immortall, he knew not what it meant, but when through his follie, hee perceiued his dayes to bee ſhorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he wondred at the one, and gréeued to remember the other. The eſtate of immortalitie wherein our firſt parentes were created, was nothing elſe but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and endurance of life, and a freedome from death. And although it be now vſuall and common, and nothing more common, then for euerie one of vs to die, yet at the firſt it was not ſo. If our firſt parents had obeied, they had neuer ſuffered death, but when they gaue themſelues to ſin and to deceitfull vanities, then they knew themſelues to be mortall, and then death came vpon them. As we read <hi>Rom. 6. 23. <hi>The wages of ſinne is death, but euerlaſting life is the gift of God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde.</hi>
                        </hi> And in the firſt Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, verſe 12. <hi>As by one man,</hi> (meaning <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man) <hi>ſinne entered into the world, and death by ſinne, and ſo death went ouer all men,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7821:112"/>
foraſmuch as all men haue ſinned: ſo that the cauſe and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe of death is ſinne.</hi> And becauſe the beſt ſort of men and women are ſinfull, though not in that degrée and in that meaſure as the wicked and vngodly are; yet becauſe euen they alſo haue procured the wrath of God, through their ſinne, they muſt néedes vndertake the puniſhment of ſinne, which is death. But there is a great difference to bee conſidered off. For death to the godly is life, and happie are they that are deliuered out of this miſerable and wretched world. For they knowe that while they are here, they are abſent from God, that is, from the enioying of his preſence. And againe they know, that if their earthly houſe, their bodies of duſt and claie be deſtroyed, they ſhall haue a building giuen of GOD, that is, an houſe not made with handes, but eternall in the heauens. For therefore they ſigh, deſiring to be cloathed with their houſe, which is from heauen, that mortalitie might bee ſwallowed vp of life, and their earthly manſion chaunged for an euerlaſting habitation. In the godly there is a great deſire of death; what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them hereunto? Euen this, that they may enioy immortalitie, and be made partakers of that part of the image of God, which by the meanes of ſinne, they were depriued off and put from. But as for the vngodly, it is nothing ſo with them. For they tremble and ſhake at the remembrance of death, as we reade of <hi>Naball,</hi> who when his wife tolde him heauie newes which was toward him, his hart died within him. The ſea men when they are toſſed vp and down with the waues of the ſea, and néer to be caſt away, &amp; their ſhip drowned, their ſoule melteth within them; ſo the wicked, their hart dieth within them, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parts of their body quake, their ſoules within ar ſore vexed, &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably tormented, with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> preſent forethought, &amp; as it were feeling, of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> euerlaſting death, and thoſe endleſſe torments which they ſhall endure. And this moueth them in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful &amp; ſecret ſort, to that feare they are in, that they know
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7821:113"/>
by death they ſhalbe taken from all their ioy, and that they ſhall paſſe from this ſhort life, which they haue here in this world, to death, and from this light death, which is no more but a ſeperation of the ſoule from the bodie, to a ſecond death which is euerlaſting death. And from death to theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are, the worme of a continuall guiltie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; the wrath of God increaſing their puniſhment from time to time; the reſtleſſe crueltie of the diuell and helliſh ſpirits to puniſh them; where there ſhalbe nothing elſe but wringing of hands, weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth. <hi>Felix</hi> the gouernour, ſhooke and trembled, when he heard <hi>Paule</hi> diſputing of righteouſneſſe and temperaunce, and of other waightie matters, as of death, the reſurrection, and of the iudgement to come, and willed him to depart out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Much like to king <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> who when he ſawe a hand writing vpon the wall, wherby was declared the end of his kingdome, and the ende of his life; his countenance chaunged, his thoughts troubled him, ſo that the ioynts of his loines were looced, and his knees ſmote one againſt the other. The feare of death is in them as it was in king <hi>Saul,</hi> (1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 20) who when he was tolde howe neare his death did approach, he was ſore affraied, his ſoule fainted within him, and he fell along on the earth, neither was there any ſtrength in him, he refuſed meate and would not be comforted, becauſe through the ſorrow of his death, he had a taſte of the death and torments which were to come. The cauſe why we loſt this benefit of immortalitie, is ſin and diſobedience, which brought vs to our death, and to our laſt home. The difference of death betwixt the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the wicked is this, the one ſort is greatly deſirous to die, the other are greatly affraied of death. That man was created vnto immortalitie we may perceiue, in that one part of man neuer dieth, which is his ſoule. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the bodie alſo ſhall receiue immortalitie at the day of reſurrection, when the generall iudgement ſhall be, and when all fleſh by the ſound of a Trumpet ſhalbe ſummoned
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7821:113"/>
togither from the foure quarters of the earth. Then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of all that haue bene departed from the beginning of the world, togither with them that ſhall die vnto the end of the world, being raiſed vp, ſhalbe ioyned vnto their ſoules, and both ſhalbe immortall, and ſhall liue for euer, either to receiue ioyes and euerlaſting bliſſe, or torments which ſhal neuer haue end. The one ſort to liue with God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the other ſort, with the diuel and the fiends of hell. Which immortalitie of the bodie, is confirmed by that of the Apoſtle writing to the Corinthians. 1. <hi>Cor 15. 52. 53. <hi>In a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, at the laſt trumpet, ſhall the dead be raiſed vp incorruptible, and we ſhall bee chaunged. For this corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortall, muſt put on immortalitie, and then ſhall death bee ſwallowed vp in victorie, death ſhall bee vtterly vanquiſhed neither ſhall it haue any further power.</hi>
                        </hi> Two men we reade of in the ſcriptures, that were partakers of this benefit of immortalitie and fréedome from death, and theſe two were taken from the earth into heauen, without any ſeperation of ſoule &amp; bodie, neither did they ſuffer death according to the vſuall courſe of men. The names of theſe men, were <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Eliah.</hi> Of <hi>Enoch</hi> we reade, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 24. And <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, that is, he pleaſed God, and he was no more ſéene, for god tooke him away, and he was tranſlated and carried vp into heauen. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 44. 14. Vpon the earth was no man like <hi>Enoch,</hi> and therefore was he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp from the earth for an example, (chap. 4. 16.) to the generations of men that ſhall come. Yet we may reade of him more plainly, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 5. By faith was <hi>Enoch</hi> taken away, that he ſhould not ſée death, neither was he founde, for God had taken him away. For before hée was taken away, he was reported of, that he had pleaſed god. Of <hi>Eliah</hi> we ſhall reade, 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 2. 11. And as <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> went walking and talking togither, behold there appeared a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of fire, and horſes of fire, and did ſeperate them twaine. So <hi>Eliah</hi> went vp by a whirle winde into heauen. And for
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7821:114"/>
the better proofe hereof, it followeth in the ſame Chapter, that certain children of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets which were at <hi>Iericho,</hi> deſired of <hi>Eliſha</hi> that they might ſend to finde him out. And ſaid vnto him; <hi>Beholde now there be with thy ſeruaunts fiftie ſtrong men, let them goe wee pray thee, and ſeeke thy maiſter, if ſo bee the ſpirite of the Lorde hath taken him vp and caſt him vppon ſome mountaine, or into ſome valley.</hi> But he anſwered them, yée ſhall not ſend, yet they were inſtant vpon him till he was aſhamed? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaide; Sende. So they ſent fiftie men whiche ſought thrée daies, but founde him not. Which two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, doo ſufficienly declare, in what eſtate man had bene, being frée from death, if he had pleaſed God. For as among men they were the moſt righteous, ſo paſſed they into heauen after an extraordinary and moſt happie ſort: to ſhewe there was a better life prepared; and alſo to bee a teſtimony of the immortalitie of ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Who were taken from the earth into the heauen, that after this life they might liue with God, enioying all happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>How mankinde was created immortall and frée from<note place="margin">Gouernment ouer all Gods creatures.</note> death, ye haue heard; and now it remaineth that I ſhould ſhewe vnto you what authoritie and priuiledge in reſpect of the gouernment of beaſtes, God gaue vnto man, and in what ſort. After that God had made all his creatures, he brought them vnto man, to ſée how he would call them, and as he called them ſo were their names. Furthermore, God had planted in the beaſtes, a kinde of reuerent feare, and dutifull ſeruice toward man. In reſpect whereof, the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> doth greatly extoll Gods goodneſſe, in that he did not only indue the ſoule of man with heauenly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but alſo in that he gaue him the dominion ouer al the workes of his hands. <hi>Pſal. 8. <hi>What is man ſaith he, that thou art mindfull of him, and the ſonne of man that thou viſiteſt him? Thou madeſt him a little lower then the Angels, to crowne him with glory and worſhip; Thou madeſt him to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7821:114"/>
haue dominion of the workes of thy hands, and thou haſt put all things in ſubiection vnder his feet. All ſheep &amp; oxen, yea and the beaſts of the field; the ſoules of the aire, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of the ſea, and whatſoeuer walketh through the pathes of the ſeas.</hi>
                        </hi> Among the reſt of the fiſhes of the ſea, I reade this of the Dolphine. Fiſhes according to their firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſaith the Authour, at the ſight of man acknowledge his dominion ouer them. And the Dolphine, though he be a moſt regall and princely fiſh, yet when he ſeeth man come neare him, he ſheweth reuerence as to his Lord. But as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mans fall and his diſobedience to God, the earth became vnfrutefull for mans cauſe; ſo alſo are all other creatures diſobient to man euen to this day. Yet as they of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are partakers of immortalitie that come neareſt to the Image of God, in all true holineſſe and vnfeined righteouſneſſe; ſo eſpecially vnto them is the rule and gouernment graunted ouer beaſtes. But they that are quite contrarie diſpoſed and enemies vnto God, in their ſinfull liues and behauiour, the beaſtes and all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, haue rather rule and gouernment ouer them, and as it were a power to ſet themſelues againſt them, and to ouermaſter them. For God doth ſometimes puniſh men by the rage of beaſtes, who herein are at Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are readie to execute his will and pleaſure. The fierceſt and cruelleſt creatures that euer god made, haue had no power ouer the godly, as we may reade in the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the bible, but rather they haue had a reuerent eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of them, as it were acknowledging the image of god in them. No beaſt ſo fierce as a lion to deuour a man, and therefore in the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the diuell is fitly compared vnto a roaring lion, ſéeking whome he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure. Yet <hi>Daniel</hi> being caſt into the lions denne, they doo not only not offer to touche him, but alſo ſit by him as though they had him in reuerence, and were ſet to guard and kéepe him. A Viper is a moſte hurtfull, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous, and deadly Worme, muche after the order
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7821:115"/>
of blind wormes &amp; ſtinging adders, and where the worme lieth it procureth death. Yet we reade <hi>Act.</hi> 28. that when the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> and his company were greatly refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of the Barbarians at <hi>Melita,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a nomber of ſticks and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heate and leapt on his hand. Now when the Barbarians ſawe the worme hang on his hand, they ſaid among themſelues; Surely this man is a murtherer, whom though he hath eſcaped the ſea, yet vengeance hath not ſuffered to liue. But he ſhooke off the worme into the fire, and felt no harme. Howbeit they waited when hee ſhould haue ſwolne, or falne downe dead ſodainly. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had looked a great while, and ſawe no inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence come vnto him, they chaunged their mindes, and ſaid; That he was a god. This holy and godly man ſhooke off the worme into the fire and felt no harme. <hi>Wiſ.</hi> 16. 10. The téeth of the venemous dragons could not ouercome them that feared god among the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy came to helpe them, and healed them. It was neither hearbe nor plaiſter ſaith the wiſe man that healed them, but thy word O Lord, which healeth all things. According as Chriſt promiſed to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. that they ſhould haue power not only ouer venemous beaſts, but ouer the diuels themſelues. Ye ſhall take away ſerpents, and if ye drink any deadly thing it ſhall not hurt you. So in the tenth Chapter of the goſpell after S. <hi>Luke,</hi> Behold I giue vnto you, ſaith Chriſt vnto his Apoſtles, power to treade on ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and ſcorpions, and ouer all the power of the enemie, and nothing ſhall hurt you. This power which he gaue to his Apoſtles, was ſo much the more manifeſt, that it was in him to giue them that gift, becauſe he himſelfe was in the wilderneſſe fortie daies among the wilde beaſtes, and had no hurt of them: yea his preſence made them amazed, whoſe anger if they had felt, they could not haue liued an houre. The Iſraelites <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 15. were in the great and terrible wilderneſſe, amongſt the firie ſerpents and ſcorpions, yet
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7821:115"/>
he was their guide. Well therefore might the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſay, <hi>Pſal. 91. <hi>Who ſo dwelleth in the ſecret of the moſt high, ſhall abide in the ſhadow of the Almightie,</hi>
                        </hi> and he that maketh God his defence and truſt, ſhall perceiue his protection to bee a moſt ſure ſafegard. There ſhall no euill come vnto him; He ſhall walke vpon the lion and the aſpe, the yoong lion and the dragon ſhall he tread vnder his féete, and be as ſafe as was the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſhooke off the viper from his hand, being neuer a whit the worſe. 1. <hi>Sa.</hi> 17. 36. King <hi>Dauid</hi> before he was exalted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and being at that time in no higher eſtate then a ſhepheard, before that he did incounter with <hi>Goliah,</hi> that great giant of the Philiſtines, that he might be ſuffered to vndertake that enterpriſe, he ſhewed king <hi>Saul,</hi> that as he was kéeping ſhéep, there came a lion and a beare to deuour and to take their praie; but he not only tooke the praie from them, but ſlue them both. <hi>Sampſon</hi> alſo of whom we reade, <hi>Iudges</hi> 14. 6. As a yoong lion roared on him, he rent him in péeces as it were a kid, and yet had nothing in his hand. The Prophet <hi>Fſay,</hi> chap. 11. 6. 7. 8. did foretell, that when Chriſt ſhould come to reſtore the image of GOD in man, from which he was fallen, he ſheweth in what obedience, cruell and fierce beaſtes be, euen to the little childe. The wolfe ſhall dwell with the lambe, and the leopard ſhall lie with the kid, and the calfe and the lion, and the fat beaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and a little childe ſhall leade them. And the Cowe and the beare ſhall féede, their yoong ones ſhall lie togither, and the lion ſhall eate ſtrawe like the bullocke. And the ſucking childe ſhall plaie vpon the hole of the aſpe, and the weaned childe ſhall put his hand vpon the cockatrice hole. What lions and beares are, we know, the leopard is a beaſt that inticeth other beaſtes vnto it, and being in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe &amp; reach, he deuoureth them. The aſpe and the cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice are two moſt hurtfull and poyſonable beaſtes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one, that is the cockatrice, deſtroyeth a man a farre off, with the forcible poyſon of his ſight. A little youth of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7821:116"/>
ſeuen or eight yeares old, as by experience we ſée, ruleth both oxen and horſes which are great and ſtrong beaſtes. Our prouerbe is, If the horſe knew his ſtrength, no man ſhould tame him. Yet euen children do rule and guide them, not that they ſo much feare the children, but becauſe they reuerence the image of God in man, euen in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Wherby they ſhewe what priuiledge in the rule and gouernment ouer beaſtes, at the firſt time when man was created, God had preferred him vnto and graunted him. The rauen is a bird that ſtandeth greatlie in néede of foode, whoſe birdes cry vnto God, wandring for lacke of meate, yet how néedie ſo euer they be, they brought the Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> his meat. As we reade 1. <hi>King. 17. 6. <hi>And the rauens brought him bread and fleſh in the morning, and bread and fleſh in the euening, and he drancke of the riuer.</hi>
                        </hi> That fierce and cruell beaſtes at Chriſt his comming ſhould be ſo milde and gentle, it giueth vs to vnderſtand what a puniſhment was laide vppon man for ſinne, in that beaſtes were not onely not vnder his rule and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but wilde and vntameable, and putting them in daunger of their liues. The Prophet <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> chapter 2. 18. telleth the Iewes, that when they ſhall repent them of their idolatrie, that in that day God will make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant for them with the wilde beaſtes, and with the foules of the heauen, and with that, that créepeth vpon the earth, that hée would ſo bleſſe them, that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould fauour them, that they ſhould haue no néede to feare, but might ſléepe ſafely. Which thing alſo is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the godly, as we may reade in the hiſtorie of <hi>Iob,</hi> Chapter 5. 22. Thou ſhalt laugh at deſtruction and death, and ſhalt not bee affraide of the beaſt of the earth; for the ſtones of the field ſhall bee in league with thée, and the beaſtes of the field ſhall be at peace with thée. At home and abroad thou ſhalt haue nothing to make thée ſorrowful, but all things before thy eyes ſhall giue thée large cauſe to giue God thankes.</p>

Now as for the vngodly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſort of men, they haue bene farre from this rule and gouernment, inſomuch that the meaneſt and the weakeſt kind of creatures haue had power ouer them. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, A flie is a beaſt which lightly no man careth for; yet <hi>Pharao</hi> king of <hi>Egipt,</hi> and all his people, were ſo troubled and moleſted with them, that great ſwarmes of them came into the kings pallace, and into his ſeruaunts houſes, and into the houſes of all the Egiptians, ſo that through all the land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> the earth was corrupt, by the ſwarmes of flies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 24.

And this is the rule that the wicked and vngodly haue ouer beaſtes, that is, that they are ſubiect vnto the beaſtes.

Yet we ſee when God determineth to worke his vengeance &amp; wrath on man for ſinne, they feare not the light of the Sunne, but come forth to performe the will of God in their might and in their rage, as I haue further declared in the Treatiſe of the worke of Gods creation. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 28.

The example is this; A king of <hi>Poland,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Popileus,</hi> a king of infamous life and manners, did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wiſh in his life to be deuoured of rattes. At laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wiſh, they ſet vpon him, as he was making

good cheare, and being well tipled, crowned with garlands, ſmeared with ſwéete ointments, and ouercome with ſurfit and exceſſe. Which rattes ſaith the authour, came from the dead carkaſſes of his vncles by the fathers ſide, which he and the Quéene his wife had poyſoned. For rattes of a huge greatneſſe being come forth, leapt vpon the feaſting tyranut, and his wife and ſonnes, and bitte them cruellie. His guard coulde not driue them away, becauſe when men were wearie, the rattes continued day and night without anie wearines. Burning fires were made, and <hi>Popileus</hi> his wife and ſonnes, were placed amidſt them; but for all that, the rats paſſing through the fire, ceaſed not to gnawe the man-queller. They aſſaid an other element and vſed the helpe of the water, and this murtherer of his fathers brethren, togither with his wife and children, were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a déepe ſtanding water. Notwithſtanding the rattes continually followed them, and made holes in the boate and veſſell where they were, inſomuch that the water ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in, they were in daunger of drowning. Wherefore the marriners fearing to be drowned, brought the veſſell to the ſhoare, where an other company of rattes méeting them, and ioyning with the former, did more gréeuouſly annoy them. Which when they perceiued, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders knowing it to be Gods vengeaunce, fledde all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. <hi>Popileus</hi> nowe hauing none to defende him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogither forſaken and forlorne of all his ſubiects and friendes, ſéeing no other helpe, got him to a high tower, where hée founde himſelfe no ſafer then he was before, but the rattes hauing as it were a greater liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, runne vp to their praie with a ſwift courſe, and there they deſtroy and deuoure the two boyes; the wife, and this wicked <hi>Popileus,</hi> that neither he nor any of his generation ſhould remaine aliue. Small creatures and weake rattes, to make an end of wicked people; and where the image of God is not, nor any ſparke of grace doth appeare, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them, brute beaſtes are of more account; and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7821:118"/>
perſons are deſpiſed and tormented of beaſtes, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe might be honoured of them, and commanded by them. Vnto the fearefull example of king <hi>Popileus,</hi> the ſame authour addeth the loathſome end of the Emperour <hi>Arnolphus,</hi> whoſe fleſh and entrailes were eaten vp of lice, and nothing left vneaten, ſaue onlie his griftles and his bones, although the phiſitians did their beſt, who can doe nothing when God ſaith nay, and hindereth their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by not giuing effect to the ſame. A king deuoured of rattes, and an Emperour of lice, mightie rulers and great gouernours, and yet had no power ouer ſuch weake crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. God did not vouchſafe them to end there liues by ſickeneſſe, or ſword, or famine, or peſtilence, but that they might be more odious and deteſtable, and of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memory to the world, and all ſuccéeding ages, it was Gods wil, that thus they ſhould be deuoured, and that their ſin ſhould not be vnpuniſhed; and that mightie men ſhould be plagued by Gods hand, who otherwiſe ſéeme to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. That Emperours and Kings, Nobles and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and all the great ones of the world, may not think, that they ſhall eſcape ſcotfrée, but as they are mightie, ſo are their mightier then they.</p>
                     <p>Thus according to that ſmall ſkill that it hath pleaſed God to graunt me, I haue brieflly diſcourſed of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall matters comprehended in the image of God in man, being created in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe; hauing Frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will at the firſt; and furthermore, crowned with immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, and fréedome from death; and laſtly, the priuiledge, ſoueraigntie, and gouernment ouer all Gods creatures, then being graunted vnto him of God.

Moſt true therefore is that generall propoſition of S. <hi>Paule;</hi> For there is no difference, for all haue ſinned and are depriued of the glory of god, euen of eternall life and happineſſe, whereat all of vs doe aime. Now ſéeing the heart of man is deceitfull, and who can knowe it?

So that by his fained and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall kind of righteouſneſſe, firſt he is in excuſable; ſecondlie, he incurreth the iudgement of God, which is according to truth, againſt them which commit ſuch things; thirdly he deſpiſeth the riches of his bountfulneſſe,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7821:120"/>
patience, and long ſuffering, not knowing that the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſſe of God leadeth him to repentaunce. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of which his hipocriſie, is this, that after his hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and heart that cannot repent, hée heapeth vp as a treaſure vnto himſelfe, wrath, againſt the day of wrath, and of the declaration of the iuſt iudgement of GOD. An other ſort there is, that willingly plucke their neckes out of the choller, and would be ſpectators and beholders of other mens miſery, by reaſon of ſinne and tranſgreſſion,<note place="margin">There is no man iuſt by excuſe.</note> thinking themſelues without ſpot and blameleſſe, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vppon this guarde, that they neuer knew the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the ſeruaunt of GOD, whereby they might direct their liues according to the will of GOD.

But more blockiſh are they, which boaſt and vaunt of the<note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of man, ſtandeth not in the knowledge of the lawe.</note> knowledge of the lawe of God, (as did the Iewes, who put all their ſafetie in this, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the oracles of God were committed to them, that the couenaunt was propper vnto them, that the temple of God was amongſt them, that they were the people of God, and the beloued of the Lord) and yet for all this, labour not to liue in the obedience of the lawe. For the Lorde choſe them as a peculiar people, that they might ſerue him in all holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, which thing they altogither neglected, thinking that God had choſen them for their worthineſſe. Wherefore the fooliſh<note place="margin">All excuſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away from them.</note> heart of man which is full of darkeneſſe, cannot deuice any way how to be righteous, but his deuices and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, is fooliſhneſſe before God, and altogither condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the ſpirituall man. For if hec thinke to bee iuſt by condemning other, breaking out into theſe words with the Phariſée. O God I thanke thée, that I am not as other men,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:7821:121"/>
extorcioners, vniuſt, adulterers, or euen as this publican, he<note place="margin">Hipocrite.</note> pronounceth the ſentence of iudgement againſt himſelf, in that comparing his life to the law, he is moſt culpable and faultie. But rather let vs vnderſtand and learne what the meaning of this is; Euerie man that exalteth himſelfe ſhalbe brought lowe, and he that humbleth himſelfe ſhalbe exalted. If he would ſtart aſide becauſe he knoweth not<note place="margin">Gentile.</note> the lawe, and ſo imagine himſelfe to be frée, his conſcience is a thouſand witneſſes, and the light of nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon commaunding and highlie commending thoſe things which are good, hating, forbidding, and puniſhing, thoſe things which are wicked and euil, ſheweth him how to liue in the ſeruice and feare of God. For in that by nature (ſaith the Apoſtle of all) they doe the things contained in the lawe, they hauing not the lawe, are a lawe vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and they that haue ſinned without the lawe, ſhall periſh without the lawe. The effect of which knowledge of God, by the light of nature and reaſon, being written in their hearts and conſciences, ſhall ridde them from all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and be moſt effectuall, yea horrible, in that dreadfull day of doome, when God ſhall iudge the ſecrets of men by Ieſus Chiſt, the bookes, that is, their conſciences, being then laid open. Laſtly if only the knowledge of the lawe<note place="margin">Iewe.</note> could preuaile, that therby we might be iuſtified and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteous, we had wherein we might reioyce. But ſéeing not the hearers, but the doers of the law, are iuſtified before God, and that God requireth a circumciſed hart, and is uot ſatiſfied with vaine ſhewes and ceremonies, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that they are not iuſt which onlie know the lawe, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>the circumciſion of the hart, I mean, the inward righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, conſiſteth in the ſpirit, not in the letter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that ſinne in the law, that is, hauing knowledge of the lawe, ſhalbe iudged by the lawe. This then is the full ſumme of the matter, that both Iewes and Gentiles are vnder ſinne, that is, are iuſtly condemned for ſinnes, and are ſubiect to the curſe which is due vnto ſinne. For
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:7821:121"/>
as with righteouſneſſe there is abſolution, ſo with ſinne there is condemnation. So that it is not in man to ridde himſelfe from the curſe of the lawe, by any deuiſed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Hitherto the drift of the Apoſtle hath beene to ſhewe, howe that mans righteouſneſſe is farre from the obedience of the lawe, and that righteouſneſſe which God requireth at our handes. And endeuouring to giue a more cleare light to the righteouſneſſe of God, hée plucketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the viſor of their faigned righteouſneſſe, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth their faces; yea he ſetteth before vs, and launceth out, the venome and corruption of our heart, comparing our righteouſneſſe, or rather our exceſſiue wickedneſſe, with the rule of the lawe, which by a fit exaggeration, he ſheweth vs as plaine, as if blacke and white were laid togither, darkeneſſe and light were weighed in a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launce. Such is therefore the righteouſneſſe of man, that<note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of man, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the lawe, howe faultie it is.</note> wée thinke our ſelues iuſt without the knowledge of the lawe, without the effectuall working thereof, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we examine our ſelues, our liues, and ſinnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Sinne is not imputed while there is no lawe, and no man is puniſhed as guiltie and faultie; For where no lawe is, there is no tranſgreſſion, and contrariwiſe, by the lawe is the knowledge of ſinne. And ſinne, that it might appeare ſinne, worketh death in vs by that which is good, that ſinne might be out of meaſure ſinfull by the commandement. Moreouer, the lawe entered thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">By the lawe is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin.</note> that ſinne might abounde, both that which is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and that which daily carrieth the ſway in our actions. The vſe of this manifeſtation, is referred to<note place="margin">The vſe of the lawe is two ſold.</note> two pointes. The firſt is, that men might be ſo much the more guiltie; Secondly, the benefit of god in Chriſt Ieſus, ſhould bee ſo much the more glorious. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond<note place="margin">VVhat the lawe is in it ſelf, and what to vs. The lawe is ſpirituall.</note> generall poynt in this compariſon is, what the lawe is in it ſelfe, and alſo hauing reſpect vnto vs. In it ſelfe it is holy, and the commaundement holy, iuſt, and good, it is ſpirituall, and requireth of vs an beauenly pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7821:122"/>
yea the heart and inwarde affection, (becauſe God iudgeth the ſecret motions of the ſame) and a chéerfulneſſe, and a willingneſſe, in the outwarde déede. So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more contrary to the lawe, then hypocriſie, lying, and deceit. Nowe then as the lawe is ſpirituall, ſo wée<note place="margin">VVe are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> are carnall, ſolde vnder ſinne, and being in the fleſh, the affections of ſinne, which are by the lawe, haue force in our members to bring foorth frute vnto death. Yea, the whole naturall man is bondſlaue to the lawe of the fleſhe and of ſinne, whiche poſſeſſeth the vnregenerate, and wholly raigneth in them. For they neither will, nor doo good; ſo that although the lawe of nature, and light of reaſon doo teach them, and informe them what is good, their conſcience bearing them witneſſe, and the lawe of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For our corrupt nature turneth the benefite of the lawe to our deſtruction; whereby it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that that is moſte peruerſe and wicked, which turneth that which is wholeſome in it ſelfe to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. In the vnregenerate man, it bringeth foorth death, and may well be accuſed of him, becauſe it hath this operation in him, that it cauſeth wrath, ſtirreth vp grudging, fretting and murmuring of our nature.<note place="margin">How the lawe is the power of ſinne.</note> For the more it preſſeth by reaſon of our infirmitie, in that wee are not able to withſtand it, it ſtirreth vp ſin, becauſe wée are readie and moſte deſirous to doo that which is ſorbidden, it is the force and power of ſinne, it increaſeth ſinne and ſlaieth vs, and maketh vs guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the wrath of God, and eternall death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Wherefore if wée ſay there is no ſinne in vs, we<note place="margin">How we do the workes of the lawe.</note> are founde liars, béeing reprooued by the lawe. And as for the outwarde woorkes of the lawe whiche wée doo, are either for feare of puniſhment, which might enſue vppon the offence, or elſe for loue of our ſelues, that we might reioyce in our owne righteouſneſſe. But
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7821:122"/>
ſéeing with our workes there is ioyned ſtubburnneſſe, and the heart rebelleth within, (becauſe the lawe repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our concupiſcence) and that naturally euen from the loines of our forefather <hi>Adam,</hi> there is ingraffed into vs a ſeruile feare, and deadly hatred of the lawe, if not of the lawe-giuer, our workes can in no wiſe come to the height that they may pleaſe GOD. The lawe therefore is ſpirituall and iuſt, and holie, and good; and by the lawe commeth the knowledge of ſinne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is euery mouth ſtopped, and all the worlde found ſubiect vnto the iudgement of God. Howe then may<note place="margin">No man iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the lawe.</note> wée imagine, that by the workes of the lawe we may bee iuſtified? ſéeing that it is ſayd, by the woorkes of the lawe ſhall no fleſh bee iuſtified. Againe, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be made righteous by the lawe, not onely to him<note place="margin">The regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſin.</note> that is not regenerate, but vnto the regenerate alſo, in that their righteouſneſſe is ſtained with ſo many ſinnes, and they culpable of iudgement before God. For the lawe cannot iuſtifie thoſe that are in the fleſh. The lawe is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, but we are carnall, ſold vnder ſinne, and enemies to God, and ſtrangers from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common wealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer therefore we thinke to pleaſe God by the outwarde workes of the lawe, yet is not that the righteouſnes which<note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, is of the heart. No iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works.</note> God requireth. For the circumciſion is of the heart, in the ſpirite, not in letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of GOD. But if <hi>Abraham</hi> bee iuſtified by workes, hée hath wherein to reioyce, but not with God, ſéeing that if iuſtification might be accompliſhed by the workes of the lawe, it were altogither debt, and not fauoure. But that ſhould not be blinded with a vaine opinion of debt and merit, there the Apoſtle croſſeth this ſentence with a contrary poſition. For to him that woorketh not, but beléeueth in him that iuſtifieth the vngodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe. Whiche afterwarde hée prooueth more manifeſtly by the fall and ruine of the Iewes, béeing compared with the Gentiles.</p>

                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:7821:123"/>What ſhall we ſay then? that the Gentiles which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteouſneſſe, haue attained vnto righteouſneſſe, euen the righteouſneſſe which is of faith. But <hi>Iſrael</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the lawe of righteouſneſſe, could not attaine vnto righteouſneſſe. Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it it were by the workes of the lawe. For they being ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of God, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, haue not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted<note place="margin">Our iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is by Chriſt.

And vnleſſe we acknowledge our ſelues to be ſinners, being voide and deſtitute of any righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is in vs, we ſéeme to deface and to darken the worthineſſe and dignitie of Chriſt. Which conſiſteth in this, that he is the onely light, ſaluation, life, reſurrection, and righteouſneſſe, and the ſoueraigne phiſicke of euery mans ſoule; and to what end? If not to lighten the blind, to reſtore them that were condemned, to quicken them which were dead, to raiſe them vp which wer brought to nothing, to cleanſe them which were polluted with all filthineſſe, to cure and heale them which were death, ſicke, and almoſt ſwallowed vp thereof. Nay but if we attribute any part of<note place="margin">He that attri buteth any thing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and wraſtleth with him.

So that Chriſt is a ſtumbling blocke, and a rocke of offence, not that it agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto him to be ſo, but that malicious mindes do take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence through their owne corruption. For they ſtumble by reaſon of their owne pride, and their damnation is in them ſelues. What ſenceleſſe blockiſhneſſe is it therefore in vs, that we ſhould deriue ſaluation, righteouſneſſe, and iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, from the lawe, which is our downfall, and the cauſe of wrath? Neuertheleſſe if we be not as yet ſatiſfied, he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an other effectuall proofe, whereby we may plainly ſée, that righteouſneſſe and iuſtification is not by the lawe. For
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7821:123"/>
the promiſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; that he ſhould be the father of many nations, (through gods euerlaſting couenant with him, that he would be his god and the god of his ſéede after him) I ſay the promiſe,<note place="margin">The promiſe is not by the lawe.</note> that he ſhould be the heire of the worlde, was not giuen to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſéede through the lawe. Firſt becauſe the lawe cannot comprehend the promiſe; ſecondly, becauſe faith ſhould be ioyned in vaine to the promiſe, which ſhould be apprehended by workes. Againe, if iuſtification depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">Iuſtification, that is, the righteouſneſſe of God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth vnto all.</note> vpon the lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then ſhould god be the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our only of the Iewes, but it is god who ſhall iuſtifie cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of faith, meaning the Iewes, and vncircumciſion through faith, meaning the gentiles. And in that, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was iuſtified being vncircumciſed, it alſo follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that iuſtification belongeth vnto them that are vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. This therefore may be the generall concluſion of this point, that we are not iuſtified by the law &amp; the works thereof, comprehended in theſe thrée propoſitions. All both Iewes and gentiles, are vnder ſinne, that is, are iuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for ſinne. All haue ſinned, and are iuſtly depriued of the glory of god, that is, of euerlaſting life. All the world is ſubiect to the iudgement of god. And herein is the praiſe of his iuſtice, in that we deſerue it, as alſo the praiſe of his mercy, in that fréely in Chriſt he forgiueth vs ſo great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. So that here it reſteth, that there is but one way of<note place="margin">But one way of ſaluation.</note> ſaluation, to wit, Ieſus Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by faith. For the goſpell of Chriſt, is the power of god vnto ſaluation, to euery one that beléeueth, to the Iewe firſt, and alſo to the Grecian. Vnto which faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though<note place="margin">VVorkes.</note> that works are neceſſarily adioyned, and are as the light which is ſéen togither with the flame, yet they auaile not vnto iuſtification, but rather ſignifie, that a man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly iuſtified before god. Therefore although faith be not without workes, yet faith alone without workes, doth<note place="margin">Faith onely, iuſtifieth.</note> iuſtifie. The lawe manifeſteth ſinne, and death which was before the lawe, it cauſeth wrath, and dooth not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile

And ſéeing righteouſneſſe is not ſound by the law, it is neceſſary and behoouefull, that we looke for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe elſewhere. And becauſe man could not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh any righteouſneſſe, therefore leaſt hée ſhould vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly periſh, God exhibiteth a way which he promiſed of olde, whereby he ſhould be iuſtified and ſaued before him,<note place="margin">Chriſt is our righteouſnes.</note> without the lawe. The matter and grounde of this righteouſneſſe, is Chriſt apprehended through faith, who is offered vnto all, becauſe all haue ſinned.

The authour of this righteouſneſſe and iuſtification is God, for hée ſo loued the world, that hée gaue his only begotten ſonne, to bee offered vp for our ſinnes, and to make full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction, that whoſoeuer beléeueth in him ſhould not periſh, but haue life euerlaſting.

The finall cauſe, is the glorie and praiſe of the goodneſſe of God, in that being enemies, hée reconcileth vs vnto him. Wherefore we are not ſaued by workes, or partly by faith, and partly by woorkes, but all our reioycing is excluded by the<note place="margin">VVe are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied not by workes, but by faith.</note> lawe of faith. And our iuſtification dependeth onely vpon GOD, that his glorie might be eſtabliſhed, for the promiſe of God is through faith, and not by the lawe.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7821:124"/>
For as the lawe is the cauſe of wrath, ſo is faith the appeaſing of our conſciences, whereby we vnderſtand, that we are iuſtified. And if any man make the lawe his grounde and his rocke, hée is fallen from grace; for they are vtterly aboliſhed from Chriſt, whoſoeuer are iuſtified by the lawe. So that they that put their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the workes of the lawe, Chriſt ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them nothing: By whome onely wee obtaine to bee called the ſonnes of god, and the heires of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, by whome we are deliuered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemed from the lawe, that wee might receiue the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of ſonnes. For GOD hath giuen the ſpirit into our hearts, that we may cry <hi>Abba father.</hi> Which ſpirit we receiue by faith, and not by the workes of the lawe, for they that are vnder the lawe, are vnder the curſe, and vnder moſte dreadfull feare. And the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall propoſition of the Apoſtle is, that no man is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the lawe, for the lawe is not of faith, but the iuſt ſhall liue by faith. For by faith wée are the ſéede, poſteritie, and children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heires by promiſe, and fellowe heires with Chriſt of his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdome. By the lawe and the couenant, there is a difference betwixt the Iewes and the Gentiles; but by by faith there is neither Iewe nor Grecian, there is neither bonde nor frée, there is neither male nor female. For all are one in Chriſt Ieſus. Therefore by faith is iuſtification, whereby the ſcriptures foreſawe that the gentiles ſhould bee ſaued, and that the lawe could giue no life, and that by the lawe there was no righteouſneſſe, becauſe the ſcripture hath concluded all vnder ſin, that the promiſe by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt ſhuld be giuen to them that beléeue. Therefore it is by faith, that it might come by grace, that the promiſe might be ſure vnto all, both them of the lawe, and to them of the ſeede of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſéeing the righteouſneſſe of man by nature, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but wickedneſſe and hipocriſie, backſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that the Apoſtle might bring vs, to the perſwaſion of the iuſtice of faith, which is the pathway and the highway vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſaith, that we know that whatſoeuer the law ſaith, it ſaith it to them which are vnder the lawe.

Whereby all ſatiſfaction falleth to the ground, in that of his frée mercy and goodneſſe, the Lord putteth away the remembrance and puniſhment of our ſinnes, forgiueth al our infirmities, redéemeth our life from the graue, and crowneth vs with mercy and compaſſion; yea, he onely forgiueth, becauſe he onely is offended. I, euen I (ſaith he) am he that putteth away thine iniquities for mine owne ſake, and will not remember thy ſinnes.

This is that righteouſneſſe of God, through the faith of Ieſus, euen the remiſſion of ſins, wherunto all the prophets witneſſe. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh by way of proclamation. Be it knowne vnto you therefore men and bretheren, that through this man, is preached vnto you the forgiuenes of ſins, and from all things from which ye cannot be iuſtified by the lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by him euery one that beléeueth is iuſtified.

And ye knowe that he was made manifeſt, that he might take away our ſinnes: In whome we haue redemption through his blood, that is the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.

Yea where ſinne abounded, there grace abounded much more; that as ſinne had raigned vnto death, ſo might grace alſo raigne by righteouſneſſe to eternall life, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde. Which righteouſneſſe of God by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, is imputed vnto all, and vpon all that beléeue. By this imputation, we are cloathed with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, through whome, we behold the face of God to be vnto vs moſt chéerefull; by whome we haue an enteraunce vnto the father; by whoſe puritie and holineſſe all our ſpottes are couered. Without which imputation all our workes are vnrighteous, for by the righteouſneſſe of faith are all our workes made perfect; and being ingraffed into Chriſt, and made partakeres of his righteouſneſſe, our<note place="margin">The effect of this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousneſſe.</note> workes are accounted before God as iuſt and righteous; in whome all our imperfections are blotted out; and thoſe workes which are done of faith, are accepted through the imputation of Chriſt his righteouſnes. For as in vs there is nothing but ſinne, ſo in Chriſt is all our ſufficiency, vpon whom, as vpon the ſacrifice, was caſt that curſe of man, that his condemnation, might be our abſolution; and our happineſſe, his righteouſneſſe; according to that of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid, who knew it by his owne experience to be moſt true, that the man is bleſſed, vnto whome God impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth righteouſneſſe without workes. Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Bleſſed is the man vnto whom the Lord imputeth not ſin, that the lord might only be iuſt, and a iuſtifier of him, that is of the faith of Ieſus. Who tooke vpon him our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was accuſed for vs, and iudged as a ſinner, not for his owne, but for the faults and tranſgreſſions of other, being himſelfe pure and without ſpot, that he might vndertake that puniſhment that was due vnto our ſins, and endue vs
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7821:127"/>
with his righteouſnes. So that now we are iuſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in him, not that we can ſatiſfie the iudgement of God by our owne workes, but that we are accounted iuſt and righteous through Chriſt, who is ours through faith. Who is made vnto vs, wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, &amp; ſatiſfaction, and redemption, that he that reioyceth, might only reioyce in the Lord; for whoſe ſake we are fréely accounted both iuſt &amp; innocent before god, in whom are ſeene the glorious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of God, that wée might bée inriched by him. For if wée looke for ſaluation, wée are taught by the very name of Ieſus, that it is in him; if wée ſéeke for any other gifte of the ſpirit, they are to bée found in his annointing; if wée ſéeke for ſtrength, it is in his dominion; if we ſéeke for cléereneſſe, it is in his conception; if we ſéeke for tender kindneſſe, it ſheweth it ſelfe in his birth; whereby he was made in all things like vnto vs, that he might learne to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe with vs. If we ſéeke for redemption, it is in his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if we ſéeke for abſolution, it is in his condmnation; if wée ſéeke for releaſe of the curſe, it is in his croſſe; if we ſéeke for ſatiſfaction, it is in his ſacrifice; if wee ſéeke for clenſing, it is in his blood; if wée ſéeke for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, it is in his going downe into hell; if we ſéeke for mortification of the fleſh, it is in his buriall, if wée ſéeke for newneſſe of life, it is in his reſurrection; if for immortalitie, it is in his victory ouer death; if we ſeeke for the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of the kingdome of heauen, it is in his entraunce into heauen; if wée ſéeke for defence, for aſſuredneſſe, for plentie and ſtoare of all good thinges, it is in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And therefore this is the diademe and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull crowne that is ſette vpon our heads, the fine linnen, and the ſilke, and the broidered worke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wée are couered; theſe are the ornaments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wée are decked, the bracelets on our hands, and the chaine that is put about our neckes; this is the frontlet on our face, the earings in our eares; this is the garment of ſiluer and gold wherewith wée are cloathed;

this is the fine flower, the hony and the oyle whereby we become ſo bewtiffull. Euen the remſſion of our ſinnes and the imputation of Chriſt his righteouſneſſe, who hath put away our tranſgreſſions like a cloud, and our ſinnes like a miſt, and filled our harts with ioy and gladneſſe, that in a ſure confidence we may break out and ſay. Nowe there is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Ieſus. Reioice therefore O ye heauens, at the goodnes and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Lord, for he only hath done it; ſhout ye lower partes of the earth; braſt foorth into praiſes yee moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,<note place="margin">3.

So then through faith, the lawe is not made of none effect, but it doeth rather eſtabliſh the lawe. For without Chriſt the lawe is not fulfilled, yea it ſetteth our concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence on fire, and maketh vs ſubiect vnto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but in Chriſt we find the exact righteouſneſſe of the lawe, for he is the end of the lawe to eucrie one that beleeueth, by whom alſo we are ſanctified, and our hearts framed to the obedience of the lawe, which though it be vnperfect, yet doth it aime at perfection. And this obedience procéedeth from faith, which through the merit of Chriſt obtaineth the holie ſpirit, which ſpirit doth make vs newe harts, doth exhilarat vs, doth incite and inflame our harts to doe the lawe willinglie. Nowe the lawe in the regenerate, that is, in thoſe whoſe ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, vnto whom the righteouſueſſe of Chriſt is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who are ſanctified, bringeth foorth good frutes.

Neither let vs thinke ſo highly of theſe frutes, as though from thence our iuſtification were deriued.

Which conflict, the Apoſtle plainly ſetteth forth before our eies, hauing ſufficient experience thereof in himſelf. For the mind of a regenerate man is ſpirituall, but he himſelf is carnall, ſold vnder ſinne, and that which he hateth, that doth he; in his fleſh there is no good thing. To wil, is preſent, but he findeth no means to perform that which is good, yea euil togither continually is preſent with him, and though his inner man delight in the lawe of God, yet doeth he ſée an other lawe in his members, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the lawe of his minde, and leading him captiue vnto the lawe of ſinne, which is in his members.

whereas before we were haters of God, and maliciouſly ſet againſt him, now through his mercy who hath written his lawes in our harts, and giuen vs a hart of fleſh, through the grace which we haue in Chriſt, we are readie and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to loue God, to feare him, and to kéepe his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,<note place="margin">God.</note> whereby he dwelleth in vs and we in him: rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to acknowledge him to be the giuer of all good thinges; readie to giue him thankes for all his benefites; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in all neceſſities and agréeuances, to pray vnto him, and to ſéeke helpe at his hands, to put our truſt only in him. Yea the image of God in a meaſure, is renued and reſtored in vs, that we might walke in newneſſe of life becauſe he is holy. And as our life and conuerſation is renewed to the glory of God, ſo is it alſo profitable to the furtherance of our neighbour, whome in all charitable order, we are as<note place="margin">Our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> willing to helpe as our ſelues, being mercifull, humble, long ſuffering, forbearing one an other, forgiuing one an other, as Chriſt forgaue vs. Prouiding for the neceſſities of one an other, as Chriſt is plenteous toward vs in all good things, hartily louing one an other, laying aſide all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not only for the loue of God and hatred of ſinne, but alſo for feare of offence, leaſt our brethren by our example, ſhould be drawne to euill.

Which ſpirit quickneth our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies, beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God: Whereby we are ridde from the ſpirit of bondage which is in feare, and are indued with that of adoption, which bringeth foorth good frutes, which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accepteth, though indéed they be of ſmall perfection &amp; not aunſwerable to that high calling which is in Chriſt.

Yea we are heires with Chriſt: Howe or in what reſpct? If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified with him. Which affliction and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the end of our ſpirituall fight, &amp; the entraunce into glory: Which in this world is to vs as a proofe of our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; our patience, a helpe to experience; our experience, a furtherer of our hope; which hope maketh vs not aſhamed,<note place="margin">The proffite of affliction.</note> becauſe the loue of God is ſhed abroad in our harts, by the holy ghoſt which is giuen vs. Againe, it maketh our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and imperfections knowen vnto vs, it correcteth our ſinfull deſires, &amp; the euill luſts of our fleſh, it bringeth vs to a mutuall and harty loue one of an other; it bréedeth in vs a couragious mind to withſtand the aſſaults of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than: it increaſeth in vs the hope of our election, frameth vs to immortality, worketh a moſt effectual and gladſome<note place="margin">Perſeuerance in affliction is the ſtay of the ſpirituall man.</note> &amp; comfortable meditation of the life to come. Only we are to take héede of this downfall, that we faint not, becauſe the crowne of glory is not giuen, but to him that ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and endureth vntill he come to the end of his race. Moreouer, vnto theſe commodities which come vnto vs by reaſon of theſe afflictions, there are alſo added moſt<note place="margin">Conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in affliction.</note> comfortable conſolations. For it is the will of God that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7821:130"/>
wée ſuffer affliction for his name ſake, and bleſſed are they that do ſo. And if God be on our ſide who can be againſt vs? All things come from the prouidence of God, if with gladneſſe wée receiue bleſſings from the Lord, why ſhould wée not in all obedience receiue puniſhment &amp; correction alſo? Wée knowe alſo, that al things worke togither for the beſt, vnto them that loue God, and to them that are called of his purpoſe. Yea our afflictions, indéed light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flitions, which are but for a moment, cauſe vnto vs a farre more excellent and an eternall waight of glory. Not that wée in reſpect of thoſe afflictions are worthy of the ſame, but becauſe it pleaſeth the father, to giue vnto his children the kingdome of heauen. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with all patience wait for the perfection of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, euen the redemption of our ſoule and body. And though wée ſigh while wée are in the fleſh, yet are wée not alone, for our bretheren alſo which haue the firſt frutes of the ſpirit, ſigh togither with vs; yea euery creature groneth with vs alſo, and trauelleth in paine euen to this preſent time, vntill it be deliuered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the ſonnes of God. And ſéeing euen the creatures ſhall be reſtored, how comfortable ſhould our hope bée, while wée looke not on the things that are ſéene, for they are but temporal, but on the things which are not ſéene, which are eternall. For the which with patience wée abide, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that our hope is not of thoſe things which wée ſée, and ſhall in time moſt certainly come to paſſe. Not only our bretheren and euery creature ſigheth with vs, but alſo the ſpirit is partaker of our gronings, and while wée offer vp our praiers to god in our afflictions and extremities, the ſpirit helpeth our infirmities, and in a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure maketh requeſt for vs, with infinite ſighes, which<note place="margin">The ſpirit a helper of our infirmities &amp; ignoraunce.</note> cannot bée expreſſed. Yea, hée helpeth alſo our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce, in that according to the pleaſure and will of God, he maketh requeſt for the ſaints, and he which

ſearcheth the harts, knoweth what the meaning of the ſpirit is. Moreouer the finiſher of our hope and the crowne of our glorie euen Chriſt Ieſus, which is dead, yea, or rather which is riſen again, who is alſo at the right hand of God, he maketh interceſſion and requeſt alſo for vs. Nowe then are there any accuſers of whome we<note place="margin">The aſſured confidence of ſaluation which wee haue in God through Chriſt.</note> ought to be affraied before God, ſeeing that God abſolueth vs as iuſt? can ſathan charge vs? or doeth his accuſations anie whit auaile? ſéeing that through faith in Chriſt, wée haue peace towards god, and our conſcience is deliuered from the guilt of ſinne? Who ſhall laie any? nay the whole burthen of our ſinnes to our charge? It is god that cleareth, it is god that iuſtifieth, yea it is Chriſt that vnladeth vs. <hi>Come vnto me</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye that are heauie laden, and I will eaſe you, and refreſh you.</hi> Who ſhall condemne vs? Is it not Chriſt that hath redéemed vs, who alſo ſhall come to be<note place="margin">A caueat.</note> our iudge?

Which heauenly treaſure, could by no other meanes be bought and purchaſed for vs, but by the precious blood of Ieſus Chriſt; who as an innocent lambe without ſpot,<note place="margin">How our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and iuſtification, is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> was offred vp for our ſinnes, euen the iuſt for the vniuſt, who being frée from ſinne, and knowing no ſinne, yet was made ſinne for vs, that is a ſacrifiſe for ſinne, that we might receiue I ſay, this rich treaſure, euen the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of God in him, redemption and iuſtification. So that the puniſhment of our ſinnes is ſwallowed vp in victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that with the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> we may in ioy burſt foorth and ſay. O death where is thy ſting? O graue where is thy victorie? The ſting of death is ſinne, and the ſtrength of

ſinne, is the lawe. But thankes be vnto God, who hath giuen vs victory through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Who ſhal ſeperat vs then from the loue of Chriſt? ſhall tribualtion, or anguiſh, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, or ſword?

                        </gap>ne of all, is this; that the righteouſneſſe of man, by reaſon of idolatry and wickednes procéeding from his corrupt nature, is abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the ſight of god; and that by no excuſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, he may acquit himſelfe before the iudgement ſeate of God; but hée is ſubiect, both Iewe and Gentile, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation which the iuſtice of God doth require. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lieth it not in mans power, by the lawe of the workes thereof, to attaine vnto righteouſneſſe, becauſe in his hart hée hateth the lawe, he being carnall, and the lawe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. As hée deſireth to hide his ſinne, ſo by the lawe, is the knowledge of ſinne, and as he ſéemeth to himſelfe, to be iuſt, before he examine his life by the lawe, (not but that by the lawe hée is condemned, but he putteth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation farre from him, and thinketh not of it (ſo is the lawe the cauſe of tranſgreſſion of ſinne and of death. Yea, the regenerate man is ſtained with ſin, therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he be iuſtified by the lawe. So that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of man, is that, which is from God by faithe in Chriſt, vnto all that beleeue. Of which righteouſneſſe, there are thrée braunches. Remiſſion of ſinnes, which is not frée from correction, though there be deliueraunce from eternal puniſhment and damnation. The ſecond braunch, is the<note place="margin">Concluſion</note> Imputation of Chriſt his righteouſnes, whereby the filthy
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7821:132"/>
garments of our ſinnes are taken from vs, and we arraied in a veſture and garment of broydered gold, I meane, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not only our ſinnes forgiuen vs, but the righteouſnes and holines of God alſo imputed vnto vs. The third branch is ſanctification and holines of life, by the which we are made fit to fulfill the lawe. Yea, ſéeing that while we are cloathed with this body of fleſh, ſinne remaineth, and that the fleſh fighteth againſt the ſpirit, we are to meditate and practiſe the mortification of our ſinfull fleſh. Hauing this aduantage, that we are vnder grace, and that alſo by Chriſt we obtaine victory. And not only to practiſe mortification, but to bring forth the frutes of the ſpirite, and of the inner man, euen the loue which we do owe vnto God, and that charitable duty which we are bound to extend to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And at all times we offer vp our ſelues as an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſacrifice vnto God, ſéeking the glory of his name, as well by our death, as by our life, knowing this, that in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions whatſoeuer, (if ſo be it we endure with patience) we ſhall not be deſtitute of comfort and conſolation. Yea ſuch, that may ſwallow vp the bitterneſſe of all torments, beſide that rich reward that is reſerued for them in the life to come, who with all confidence and boldneſſe, willingly and readily confeſſe Chriſt before men, ſtanding to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of their faith, and the aſſuredneſſe of their vndoubted hope, euen to the ſheading of their blood. Now the God of all comfort and conſolation, euen the God of peace, which brought againe from the dead our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the great ſhepheard of the ſhéepe, through the blood of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting couenant, make vs perfect in all good workes to doo his will, working in vs that which is pleaſant in his ſight, through Ieſus Chriſt; To whom with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, be all praiſe, dominion, and power, both now and for euer,</p>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7821:133"/>
dutie, who ſo oftentimes doth commend vnto vs, and teach Predeſtination, and yet neuer ceaſeth to preach the word of God. Alſo ſaith moreouer; As he that hath receiued the gift can better exhort and preach, ſo he that hath receiued this gift, doth hear the preacher more obediently, and with greater reuerence, &amp;c. We do therefore exhort and preach, but they only which haue eares to heare, do heare vs qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and to their comfort: and in thoſe that haue them not, this ſentence is fulfilled, That hearing with their eares, they do not heare, for they heare with outward ſence, but not with the inward conſent. Now why ſome men haue theſe eares, and others not, it is, becauſe it is giuen to ſome to come, and to others not. Who knew Gods counſell? muſt that be denied which is plaine and euident, becauſe that cannot be knowne which is hid and ſecret? Againe in the 15. Chapter; I pray you (ſaith he) if ſome vnder the ſhadow of Predeſtination, giue themſelues to ſlothful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and as they are bent to flatter their fleſh, to follow their owne luſts, muſt we therefore iudge, that this which is written of the foreknowledge of God is falſe? Now ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is verie handſome, and to the purpoſe, that we ſhall not ſpeake that which by the ſcripture is lawfull to ſpeake. Oh we feare (ſay you) leaſt he ſhould be offended which is not able to vnderſtand and take it. And ſhall we not feare ſay I, leſt while we do hold our tongues, he that is able to take the truth, be taken and ſnared with falſhood and error? Alſo in the twentie chapter of the ſame booke, he writeth in this ſort. If the Apoſtles and Doctors of the Church, which came after them, did the one and the other, both teaching the eternall election of God purely and truly, and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the faithfull in godly life and manners, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth theſe our aduerſaries (ſéeing they are ouercome with the manifeſt and inuincible trueth, to thinke they ſpeake well, ſaying; Although this doctrine of Predeſtination be true, yet it ought not to be preached vnto the people. Nay ſo much the rather it is good to be throughly preached, that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7821:133"/>
he that, hath eares to heare, may heare. And who hath them? But he that hath receiued them of God, who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to giue them. And as for him that doth receiue it, let him refuſe it if he will, ſo that he that doth receiue it, may take it, drinke it, be ſufficed, and haue life. For as we muſt preach the feare of God, to the end that God may be truly ſerued, ſo muſt wée preach predeſtination, that he which hath eares to heare may heare, and reioyce in God, not in himſelfe, for the grace of God towards him. This is the mind, of that excellent Doctor, as touching this point. Which notwithſtanding, bindeth vs to two conditions.

                        <p>THe Lord God, that he might put in execution his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counſaile to his glory, prepared a way according to his infinit wiſedome, indifferent both to thoſe that hée would chooſe, and thoſe alſo which he would refuſe. For when he determined to ſhewe his infinit mercy in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the elect, and alſo his iuſt iudgement in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the reprobate, it was neceſſary that he ſhould ſhut vp both vnder diſobedience and ſinne, to ſhew his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to all thoſe that beléeue, that is to ſay, to the elect, (becauſe faith is a gift of God, which properly belongeth to the elect) and contrariwiſe, to haue iuſt cauſe to condemne them to whom it is not giuen to beléeue, nor to know gods miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Therefore god did this in ſuch ſort, and with ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that the whole fault of the reprobates damnation, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in themſelues, and on the other ſide, all the glorie and praiſe of the elects ſaluation, belongeth wholly to his only
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7821:141"/>
mercy. For he did not create man a ſinner, for then hée<note place="margin">The creation of man.</note> ſhould haue béene (with reuerent feare be it ſpoken, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſinne, which afterwards he could not iuſtly haue puniſhed) but rather he made him after his owne image, to wit in innocency, puritie, and holineſſe. Who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding without conſtraint of any, neither yet forced by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny neceſſity of concupiſence, as touching his will, (which<note place="margin">Mans fall.</note> as yet was not made ſeruant to ſinne) willingly and of his owne accord rebelled againſt God, binding by his meanes, the whole nature of man to ſinne, &amp; ſo conſequently, to the<note place="margin">Adam fell not by chaunce.</note> death of body &amp; ſoule. Yet we muſt confeſſe, that this fall, came not by chaunce or fortune, ſéeing his prouidence doth ſtretch foorth it ſelfe euen to the ſmalleſt things. Neither can we ſay, that any thing doth happen that God knoweth not, or careth not for, except we would fall into the opinion of the Epicures, from the which God preſerue vs; neither yet by any bare or idle permiſſion or ſufferaunce, which is ſeperate from his will &amp; ſure determination. For ſéeing he hath appointed the end, it is neceſſary alſo, that he ſhould appoint the cauſes which leade vs to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ende. Vnleſſe we affirme with the wicked Manichées, that this end hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth at all aduentures, or by meanes of cauſes ordained by ſome other God. Furthermore, we cannot thinke that any thing happeneth contrary to gods wil, except we deny<note place="margin">Enchiri. ad Laurent Cap. 99.</note> blaſphemouſly, that he is omnipotent and almightie. As Saint Auguſtine noteth plainly in his booke <hi>De correptione gratia Cap.</hi> 104.

And this is done as we ſaid before, that he might ſhewe the riches of his glory towards the veſſels of his mercy; And his wrath and power vpon thoſe veſſels, which he hath made to ſet foorth his glory by their ſhame and confuſion.

And alſo that ſuch praiſes and words which the ſcriptures approue, be expounded fitly, leaſt otherwiſe any man ſhould take occaſion of offence, which as yet is rude and ignorant.

Likewiſe we muſt take héed, that we haue not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the weake, that they in the meane ſeaſon which are apt to vnderſtand be neglect, and not ſufficiently taught. Whereof we haue notable examples in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to vs the wiſedome and circumſpection which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in this matter, chiefly in the 9. 10. 11. 14. 15. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Epiſtle to the Romanes.

                        <p>What then remaineth?

Except perchance they haue to doo with open blaſphemers, and contemners of God, who haue néed of nothing elſe, but the ſharpe prickes of Gods iudgement: or elſe with men ſo trained and exerciſed in Gods word, that there be no ſuſpition of any offence. Finally, that they neuer ſo propound this doctrine, as if it ſhould be applied to any one man particularly, (although men muſt be vſed after diuers ſorts, ſome by gentleneſſe, and ſome by ſharpneſſe) vnleſſe ſome Prophet of God be admoniſhed by ſome eſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation.

Then if by this doctrine we had but this one commoditie, that we might learne to aſſure and confirme our faith againſt all brunts that might
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:7821:171"/>
happen, it is manifeſt, that they which ſpeake againſt and reſiſt this artickle of religion, either through their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or elſe through ignorance, or ſome fooliſh blind zeale, (which happeneth when men will meaſure God according to the capacitie of their owne wits) ſubuert and deſtroy the principall ground and foundation of our ſaluation. And in very déed although ſome (as I muſt confeſſe) do it not purpoſely, yet do they open notwithſtanding, the doore to all ſuperſtition and impietie. As for them, which now adaies maliciouſly oppugne the truth, I beſéech the Lord, euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart, either to turne their mindes (if ſo be they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the elect) or elſe to ſend them a moſt ſpéedy deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that by their owne example, they may confirme and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh that doctrine, which ſo maliciouſly they reſiſt.

                        <p>Now to touch bréefely, how this doctrine may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let vs marke that all the workes of GOD, euen the leaſt of all, are ſuch, that men cannot iudge of them, but in two ſorts. That is, either when they are done, or elſe by foreſéeing them to come to paſſe, by the diſpoſition of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and manifeſt cauſes, whoſe effects haue bin diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by long vſe obſerued.

But becauſe theſe are moſt high miſteries, and therefore ſtand in the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe cauſes which paſſe all naturall things, wée mnſt néedes ſéeke further and come to Gods word; which, foraſmuch, as without all compariſon, it is more certaine then mans coniectures, ſo it can beſt direct vs herein, and aſſure vs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="325" facs="tcp:7821:171"/>The ſcripture then witneſſeth, that all thoſe that God<note place="margin">How a man may haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his election.</note> hath according to his counſell predeſtinate, to be adopted his children through Ieſus Chriſt, are alſo called in their time appointed, yea and ſo effectually, that they heare the voice of him that calleth, and beléeue it, ſo that being iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſanctified in Ieſus Chriſt, they are alſo glorified. Wilt thou then, whoſoeuer thou art, bee aſſured of thy predeſtination, and ſo in order of thy ſaluation, which thou lookeſt for, againſt all the aſſaultes of Sathan? Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured I ſay, not by doubtfull coniectures, or our owne fancie, but by arguments and concluſions, no leſſe true and certaine, then if thou were aſcended into heauen, and had heard of Gods owne mouth, his eternall decrée and purpoſe? Beware thou beginne not at that moſt high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée, for ſo thou ſhouldſt not be able to ſuſtaine the moſt ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light of Gods maieſtie. Begin therefore beneath at the loweſt order, and when thou ſhalt heare the voice of god ſound in thine eares, and in thy heart, which calleth thée to Chriſt the onely Mediator, conſider by litle &amp; litle, and trie<note place="margin">By what ſigns faith is known</note> diligently if thou be iuſtified &amp; ſanctified in Chriſt through faith. For theſe two be the effects or frutes, whereby the faith is knowne which is their cauſe. As for this, thou ſhalt partly know by the ſpirit of adoption, which crieth within thée, <hi>Abba father;</hi> and partly by the vertue &amp; effect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſpirit which is wrought in thée. As if thou fal, and ſo declare indéed, that although ſin dwell in thée, yet it doth no more raigne in thée. For is not the holy Ghoſt he that cauſeth vs not to let ſlippe the bridle, and giue libertie willingly to our naughtie and vile concupiſcences, as they are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whoſe eyes the prince of this world blindeth; or elſe who moueth vs to pray when we are cold &amp; dull, and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Who ſtirreth vp in vs thoſe vnſpeakeable gronings? Who is he that when we haue ſinned (yea and ſometimes wittingly and willingly) ingendereth in vs an hate of the ſinne committed, and not for the feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we haue therefore deſerued, but becauſe we
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7821:172"/>
haue offended our moſt mercifull father? Who is he I ſay, that teſtifieth vnto vs, that our ſighings are heard, and alſo moueth vs to call daily, God our God, and our father, euen at that time, when we haue treſpaſſed againſt him? Is it<note place="margin">The aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the vocation is knowen by faith, and ſo by the vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> not that ſpirit, which is fréely giuen to vs as a gift, for a ſure and certaine pledge of our adoption? Wherefore if wée can gather by theſe effects, that we haue faith, it followeth that we are called, and drawen effecttually. And againe, by this vocation which we haue declared properly to belong to the children of God, that is euidently proued, which wée tooke in hand to ſhewe, that is, foraſmuch as we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate by the eternall counſell and decrée of God (the which he had determined in himſelfe) to be adopted in his ſonne, therefore we were giuen to him. Whereof the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion<note place="margin">The confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere and to be ſaued, is ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> followeth, that ſince by the moſt conſtant will of God, which onely is grounded on it ſelfe, and dependeth on none other thing, we are predeſtinate, and no man can take vs out of the hand of the ſonne: Alſo ſéeing that to continue and perſeuere in the faith is neceſſary, it followeth I ſay, that the hope of our perſeueraunce, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and ſo conſequently our ſaluation, ſo that to doubte any more of it, is euill, and wicked. So farre then it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon to ſay, that this doctrine maketh men negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or diſſolute, that contrariwiſe this alone doth open vs the way, ſearch out and vnderſtand by the power of the holy Ghoſt, Gods déepe ſecrets, as the Apoſtle plainly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, to the end that when we know them (albeit, wée knowe them here in this world but after a ſort, ſo that wée muſt daily fight with the ſpiritual armour againſt diſtruſt) we may learne to behaue our ſelues not idely, but rather to perſeuere valiantly to ſerue and honour God, to loue him, to feare him, to call vpon him, that daily more and more as ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> aſmuch as in vs lieth, we may make our vocation and election certaine. Moreouer, how ſhall he ſtand ſure and conſtant againſt ſo many gréeuous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, both within and without, and againſt ſo many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7821:172"/>
of fortune (as the world doth terme it) that is not well reſolued in this point, which is moſt true; That is, that God according to his goodwill, doeth all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they be, and what inſtruments and meanes ſoeuer he vſeth in working of the ſame, for the commodity of his elect. Of the which number he is, that findeth himſelfe<note place="margin">The election only dooth comfort vs in all afflictions.</note> in this daunger and trouble. As touching the other point, which concerneth Reprobation, becauſe no man can call to mind the determinate purpoſe of election, but at the ſame iniſtant the contrary will come to remembraunce, (beſides that in the holie ſcripture theſe two are oftentimes ioyned togither) it muſt néedes be, that ſuch as eſtéeme this part curious or vnprofitable, and therefore not to be talked off,<note place="margin">The doctrine of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cught not to be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, neither applied to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular company, but wiſely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> doo great iniury to the ſpirit of God. Therefore this part is to be waied and conſidered, but with ſuch modeſtie, that the height of gods iudgements may at all times bridle our curious fancies, in ſuch ſort, that we doo not apply it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to any man, nor to any certaine company. For in this alſo it differeth from election, becauſe election (as hath bene ſaid) is reuealed to vs by the ſpirit of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſelues, not in others, whoſe hearts wee cannot know. And Reprobatiou is euer hid from men, except it be diſcloſed by God, contrary to the common courſe of thinges. For who can tell, if god haue determined to ſhewe mercy at the laſt houre of death, to him which hath ſpent all his life paſt lewdely and wickedly? But this truſt ought not to incourage any man to maintaine, and continue in his ſinne and vngodlineſſe. For I ſpeake of thoſe things which we ought to conſider in others; for the examples of ſuch mercy of god are very rare, neither any man that is wiſe, will promiſe to himſelfe through a vaine ſecuritie and truſt, that thing which is not in his owne power. It is therefore ſufficient if we vnderſtand ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that there be veſſels prepared to perdition. The which ſéeing, God doth not reueale vnto vs who they are, we ought both in example of life and praier, diligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7821:173"/>
to winne and recouer to their ſaluation, yea euen very ſuch, of whom by ſéeing their horrible vices, we almoſt<note place="margin">VVe muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to winne all men.</note> diſpaire. And if we obſerue this order, we ſhall receiue greate fruite of this doctrine. For,</p>
                        <p>Firſt by the knowledge héereof, we ſhall learne hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly<note place="margin">The doctrine of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, maketh men humble.</note> to ſubmitte our ſelues to the maieſtie of God, ſo that the more we ſhall feare and reuerence him, the more we ought to labour, to confirme in our ſelues the teſtimonie of our election in Chriſt.<note place="margin">It maketh the grace of God, to be better knowen of the Elect.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, when we ſhalldiligently conſider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which through the mercy of God is betwixt men, which are all a like ſubiect to the ſelfe ſame courſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction, it cannot be, but we muſt acknowledge and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace more earneſtly the ſingular goodneſſe of GOD, then if we did make this grace common to all men indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renly, or elſe referred the cauſe of the inequalitie of this grace to men.<note place="margin">It bringeth a Godly care.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, when we knowe that faith is an eſpeciall gift of God, ſhall we not receiue it more willingly when it is offered, and be more carefull to haue the ſame to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, then if we ſhould imagine (as ſome do) that it is in euerie mans power, to turne and repent when he will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (they ſay) the Lord would that all men ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and will not the death of a ſinner?</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, when we ſée the doctrine of the Goſpell not only deſpiſed of all the world, but alſo cruelly perſecuted;<note place="margin">It doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and when we ſée ſo great falſhood &amp; rebellion among men, what thing can better confirme and fortifie vs, then to be aſſured that nothing chaunceth by fortune, that God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his, and that they which commit theſe things (except GOD turne their hearts) are thoſe which are deſtinate, not by chaunce, but by the ſure and eternall counſell of God, to be as it were a glaſſe, wherein the anger and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God doth appeare.</p>
                        <p>Truth it is, theſe things can neuer be ſo commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and perfectly treated of, that mans reaſon and witte

But let the diuel roare and diſcontent himſelfe, and the wicked kicke and winſe: yet their owne conſcience ſhall reprooue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, when as ours, being confirmed in the truth, by the grace and mercy of god, ſhall deliuer and frée vs in the day of Chriſt.

                           <p>The third effect of the ſpirit of God is, that it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to pray, when we are cold &amp; ſlouthfull, who ſtirreth vp in vs vnſpeakable gronings.</p>

                           <p>The fourth effect is, that when we haue ſinned, yea and ſometimes wittingly and willingly, it ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in vs a hate of the ſinne committed, and not for the feare of puniſhment which wee haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſerued, but becauſe we haue offended our moſt mercifull father.</p>

Wherefore we humbly craue thy mercy, and the grace of forgiueneſſe in Ieſus Chriſt, for therein we confeſſe, ſtandeth the only hope of our comfort and welfare. And foraſmuch as it hath pleaſed thée to giue thine owne ſonne to be a flaine ſacrifice for our ſinnes, and to offer the grace of reconciliation, by the preaching of the Goſpell to all them that repent and beléeue the ſame: good Lord we beſéech thée, vouchſafe to make vs of that bleſſed number, worke true repentance in our hearts, increaſe our faith, and giue vs grare to bring foorth the frutes thereof, that ſo it may appeare, that we haue not receiued thy holy grace in vaine. And for this purpoſe, good Lord we beſéech thee, bleſſe the Miniſtery of thy word, at this preſent, gius me grace to ſpeak it, as it ought to be ſpoken, ſincerely and boldly: giue grace to this people to he are it attentiuely and reuerently: giue grace to vs all to beléeue it ſtedfaſtly, to follow it obediently, and conſtantly to continue euen to the end. That ſeruing thée faithfully in this life, we may liue and raigne with thée for euer in the life to come, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

And yet great reaſon there is, that you ſhould be ſtrange, becauſe as yet I haue ſhewed no dutie, wherby I might in ſome ſort, warrant my ſelfe of your fauoure and friendſhip. The godly minde wherewith Gods ſpirit no doubt hath indued you, may be ſome cauſe, to procure your fauour toward me, if it were but for my profeſsion ſake. And ſo much the more, becauſe you carry a name in <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> to be a great fauourer of the Goſpell, and if I

ſhould adde the peoples report, of a good Iuſticer, I might be iudged to flatter. And yet there is no cauſe. For where the word of God hath taken deep roote, there of neceſsitie followeth all vprightneſſe, both in life and office. To procure your Worſhips good will toward me, I haue at this time, though boldly, offered vnto your view, ſome part of my laboure, which as you like it, ſo I hope you will accept it, and your good liking ſhal giue it both countenance and credit inough. And ſeeing your credit is great in the furtherance of the Goſpell, ſo I would humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt you, to promote and further the ſame more and more, to the vtmoſt of your power. Though it bee my requeſt, yet is it Gods cauſe and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which may both ſtirre you vp, and alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you, who need not my perſwaſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward inough of your owne diſpoſition and good nature.

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7821:186"/>
                     <hi>Ioſiah</hi> was famous for Religion, and none more zealous; the ſolemne keeping of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that was in his daies, doth declare it. King <hi>Cyrus</hi> hee is appointed of God, to deliuer the Iewes, from their captiuitie and thraldome. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heathen Kings there were in the worlde, yet it pleaſed God that his glorie ſhould bee ſet forth by none ſo much, as by King <hi>Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> who wondrouſly ſet foorth the praiſes of God; was a notable meane to deface idolatrie; that God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie might bee truly ſerued. And although no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table men, bee not all Kings, yet vnder Kinges, great matters are committed vnto them, and they are rulers vnder Princes, and in the places where GOD hath ſeated them, hee dooth giue them honour as is meete for them, and agreeable to their eſtate. Eſpecially hee crowneth them with honour, which honour him. What worke more notable, then the preaching of the Goſpell? and that the Nobilitie, and alſo Gentlemen of good calling and credit, might ſee it performed, in the places where they dwell, and about them.

We our ſelues alſo, ſaith the Apoſtle, were in times paſt, vnwiſe, diſobedient, deceiued, ſeruing the luſts, and diuers pleaſures, liuing in maliciouſneſſe and enuie, hatefull, &amp; hating one an other. But when the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſſe and loue of God our Sauiour, toward man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reared, not by the workes of righteouſneſſe which we haue done, but according to his mercy he ſaued vs, by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the newe birth, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controuerſie, greate is the miſterie of godlineſſe, which is, God is manifeſted in the fleſh, iuſtified in the Spirit, ſéene of Angels, preached vnto the Gentiles, beléeued on in the world, and receiued vp in glory. Which miſterie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it lay in the beginning of the world, as hid and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, yet nowe is reuealed, &amp; hath appeared, and this ſauing health hath nowe ſhewed it ſelfe, &amp; the grace of God which bringeth ſaluation vnto all, hath bene made manifeſt vnto all.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:7821:189"/>
world, men loued darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe in the workes of darkeneſſe, all their delight was ſet. And howe can this grace being offered, take any place in our hearts, before we haue remorce of our wicked waies; before we féele and perceiue the gréeuouſneſſe of our ſinnes; and haue a deſire to leaue and forſake them, before we hunger and thirſt for this grace? This is euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light of the world, which did ſhine abroad, and yet the world knewe it not, Chriſt came vnto his owne, &amp; his owne receiued him not. Oh howe ſecret are God his iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that his grace is hid from ſome, and appeareth vnto other! And yet howe is this grace hid? But fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, that make more account of their pleaſures and fulfilling of their luſts, who make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their wealth and riches (as it is ſet downe in the parable of the ſéede caſt in the earth) then they do of this grace, yea, of this rich grace, who cleaue vnto the world, and loue the world more then God. In whoſe mindes and hearts, the God of this world, that is to ſay, the diuil, doth raigne by his temptations. As the Apoſtle witneſſeth, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. If our goſpell, and if this grace of God be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt. In whom, the God of this world hath blinded the mindes, that the light of the glorious goſpell of Chriſt, ſhould not ſhine vnto them. And as the world knew him not, and his owne people to whom he was ſent, receiued him not, ſo as many as did receiue him, to them he gaue power to be the ſonnes of God, euen to them that beléeue in his name, and ſo are partakers of his grace. Which are borne not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God. Which grace, although it hath bine a miſtery, hid ſince the world beganne, and from all ages, yet nowe is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to his ſaincts, to his beloued, and thoſe that do receiue him. To whom God would make knowne, what is the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this glorious miſtery among the gentiles; which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is Chriſt, the hope of glory, in euery one of vs that are ſaued. Whom we preach ſaith the Apoſtle, admoniſhing
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:7821:190"/>
euery one, and teaching euery man in all wiſdom, that wée may preſent euery man perfect in Chriſt Ieſus, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one may be capable of this grace. For God that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the light to ſhine out of darkeneſſe, is he, which hath ſhined in our hearts, to giue the light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; hath ſent vs foorth to preach, that this his grace, may euery where appeare. Which doth appeare and ſhewe it ſelfe to all, but ſo, that the repentant ſinners, the faithfull beléeuers, &amp; thoſe onely that are made righteous in Chriſt, do receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. Who as by this grace they are receiued into the fauour of God, their ſinnes being forgiuen them, ſo are they not in any ſort to take a libertie vnto themſelues to ſinne againe. The lawe entred hereupon, that the offence ſhould abound and be made notorious, neuertheleſſe where ſinne aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, their grace abounded much more. That as ſin had raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto death, ſo might grace alſo raigne by righteouſneſſe vnto eternall life, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. What ſhall we ſay then? Shall we continue ſtill in ſinne, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> grace may abound? God forbid. How ſhal we y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are dead to ſinne, liue yet therein? After the Apoſtle had ſhewed, that by grace &amp; the mercy of god wée were ſaued, fréely beloued, fréely iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and made righteous, he ſheweth alſo howe we are ſanctified, &amp; that is by practiſiing all good workes, &amp; ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinning in this grace. As we reade. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 8. This is a true ſaying, &amp; theſe things I wil thou ſhouldeſt affirm &amp; teach, that they which haue beléeued in god, might be carefull to ſhew foorth gods workes.

                     <p>The grace of God, it teacheth, that there is no heauenly gift where with we are indued, but commeth of God, who is the fountaine, from whence godlineſſe, learning, wiſedome, and all other excellent gifts doo flow. When Gods outward bleſſings be in aboundance with vs, by his grace we know, that his prouidence doth enrich vs, and not our labour, our wiſedome, or wealth, but the bountifull hand of God which is all in all. Whereby we are perſwaded to loue and feare God, to haue a reuerent regard of him, to make our praiers vnto him, ſéeing all our welfare and good eſtate dependeth on his bleſſings. Whereas being voyd of Gods grace, and wanting his holy ſpirit to direct vs and our thoughts, with king <hi>Pharao,</hi> we aſke who is God? and with the wicked ſort, we ſay; What profit ſhall we haue, if we ſerue him, and pray vnto him, becauſe our vnlawfull and vngodly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, be not granted vs. Being throughly inſtructed by Gods ſpirit, we then learne that there is no meane ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall to make God our friend as praier is, eſpecially if it be well and rightly vſed as it ought to be. And when the feare of God, by his grace is planted in our hearts, then begin we to know, that there is a heauen, and the ioyes of heauen reſerued for thoſe that doo well; and hell and gréeuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, prepared for them that follow euill waies, and are delighted with doing euill. And when we knowe and are taught by Gods ſpirit, that all, both heauenly and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefits come to vs from God, ſo alſo we learne, that
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:7821:192"/>
when any croſſe, or any affliction, and trouble, and loſſe, and caſualtie dooth befall vs, that it is gods hand and his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to ſtrike and to puniſh vs for our ſinnes. It is the powerfull effect of gods grace, to bréede in vs a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minde, euen towardes our enemies, and which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, that it is Gods will and commaundement, that we ſhould forgiue others, as we our ſelues would bee forgiuen. But if this alteration and ſanctification be not bred in vs by Gods grace, that teacheth vs to denie vngodlineſſe, howe were it poſſible, but that with the world we ſhould be moſt prophanely minded, and as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without God, in this preſent world.</p>
                     <p>This word vngodlineſſe, toucheth not only the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our mindes, and our heatheniſh imaginations, but hath reſpect alſo vnto ſuperſtition and all hereſies in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For the darkeneſſe of our deceiued mindes doth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in go farre aſtray, and are ſo mightily ouercome by it, that diuers, nay inſinite multitudes, are vtterly ouerthrowne hereby. As we reade in the goſpell, that toward the latter end of the world, hereſies and errour ſhall ſo abound, that if it were not for Gods grace, and his inſtructing ſpirits, euen the elect ſhould bee deceiued, and togither with the reſt, ſhould be danmed. For damnation is the effect of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and hereſie, and the diuell blinding vs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing vs, dooth vſe that forcible meane to draw vs from the knowledge of God, and of our owne ſaluation. Which thing, the Apoſtle writing to the Theſſalonians, 2. Epiſtle chapter 2. dooth witneſſe vnto vs, that falſe teachers ſhall come vnto vs to deceiue vs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ued. And therefore God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould beléeue lies, and that all they might be damned, which beléeued not the truth. Many are the hereſies that are ſprung vp in the worlde, and where the word of God is not their guide,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:7821:193"/>
and the ſpirit of God doth not teach them, there is nothing but wandring &amp; going aſtray in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vanitie of their thoghts. For the true God, the heathen worſhip the Sun, the Moone, and the Starres; the Turke his Mahomet, another people fall downe before Images, créepe to croſſes, goe in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to the reliques of Saintes, put the only hope of their ſaluation in their good workes, and if that ſerue not, they make account that the praiers of them that are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, ſhall doo them good after they be dead, and releaſe them being in torments. They make their praiers vnto Saintes, and thinke by pardons and indulgences, and ſuch meanes, to haue their ſinnes forgiuen them, bee they neuer ſo many, ſo great, ſo hainous, and ſo grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous. But when the grace of God dooth teach vs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct vs, and lighten our mindes, then all blind ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and vngodly hereſies, vaniſh away at the triall of the truth, euen as the fogges and miſtes doo breake away when the Sunne appeareth in his force. And well may ſuch falſe opinions vaniſh away, becauſe they are but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Copper beareth a ſhewe of golde, and may bee flouriſhed ouer to deceiue the eye of the ſimple, but when it commeth to bee tried by the touchſtone, it appeareth to be a vaine thing, and a thing of no account in compariſon of gold. So all ſuperſtition and hereſies, may goe for true religion in the mindes of ſimple and ignoraunt people, but when they come to the touchſtone, the true triall, I meane the word of God, then if the grace of God do worke in our hearts, by the reading and hearing of the word, then wee beginne to denie the vngodlineſſe of falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and daily more and more wee growe in this grace and in the knowledge of his truth. The ignorant mindes of the Heathen, worſhipping the Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres, when GOD graunteth them of his knowledge, as no doubt GOD vouchſafeth ſome, they ſhall vnderſtand that the Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres, are but Gods creatures, and that there is a
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:7821:193"/>
Creator that made them, and a Redéemer that died for them. For the mercy of God ſhall be preached throughout the world, and then ſhall the end of the world come. The Turkes, although many of them, and that the moſt part of them mocke and ſcoffe at our crucified Chriſt, yet the ſeale of God remaineth ſure, and ſome are called to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and God forbid y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the grace of God ſhould be denied vnto them, although thouſands of them do periſh. They may be inwardly touched, and God may vouchſafe them of fauour, and make them partakers of his mercy, and they may beleeue, althogh they make not ſo ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith and beliefe. Thoſe whom we call Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who are deceiued concerning the truth of religion, and the certaintie of their ſaluation, and giue their names and conſent vnto falſhood, before they haue had iuſt triall of the truth, many of them are not perſwaded, nor euer will yéeld to be perſwaded, becauſe the grace of god to them hath not as yet appeared. For why? they are carried away with high conceits of their owne deceiued mindes. They thinke their owne inuentions and traditions, to be of equall force with Gods word, whereas they ſhould in all humble ſort, ſubmit themſelues the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> unto, they thinke ſo highly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that by their owne good workes they may deſerue heauen, ſo that the ſaluation of God which commeth by his grace and mercy, is troden vnder their féete. What are pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, and reliques, and praiers to ſaints, and purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but mans inuentions? Which they can neuer approue to be good, neither ſhall they euer finde warrant for them in Gods word. The grace of God teacheth them to deny the vngodlineſſe of mens deuices, inuentions, and traditions; and ſo much the more, becauſe God hath pronounced a curſe to them that ſhall adde, or put too, or diminiſh, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any thing from his word. I proteſt ſaith the ſpirit of of God vnto euery man (<hi>Reu.</hi> 22. 18. 19.) that heareth the words of the Prophecie of this booke, if any man ſhall adde vnto theſe things, God ſhal adde vnto him the plagues that

are written in this booke. And if any man ſhall diminiſh of the words of the booke of this prophecie, God ſhall take away his part out of the booke of life, and out of the holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and from thoſe things which are written in this booke. Daungerous therefore are the deuices and traditions of men, and likewiſe in a moſt dangerous eſtate are they who are ruled by them, becauſe that in them are contained many thinges that are contrary to the will of God and to his word. What is it for vs to be perſwaded that we ſhalbe ſaued by our good workes, (although good works be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and commanded) when the truth of Gods word ſhal direct vs, that only by the grace and mercy of God we are ſaued, and not by good workes; let them beare neuer ſo glorious and gliſtering a ſhewe in the ſight of men, and ſéeme neuer ſo much to be approued. <hi>Ephe. 2. 8. <hi>By grace are ye ſaued through faith, &amp; that not of your ſelues, it is the gift of God, not of workes, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt himſelfe.</hi>
                        </hi> The moſt righteous men next vnto our ſauiour Chriſt that euer liued, when they make their praiers vnto God, what ſay they?

O Lord be mercifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs that haue ſinned, we haue committed iniquitie and done wickedly, yea we haue rebelled and departed from thy commandements. O Lord, righteouſneſſe belongeth vnto thée, and vnto vs, open ſhame. As <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſo alſo righteous <hi>Abraham,</hi> confeſſeth of him ſelfe; I am but duſt and aſhes, and as one of no account. God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the humble, and thoſe that confeſſe their ſinnes, as for the proude, and them that vaunt and boaſt, and make ſo great account of their good workes, God beholdeth them a farre off. A lowly, an humble, and contrite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is the onely ſacrifice that god accepteth. The grace of god worketh lowlineſſe and humbleneſſe in our hearts; it frameth vs to confeſſe our ſinnes, and by all meanes to
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7821:194"/>
endeuour to amend, and neuer boaſt our ſelues of our good workes, or to truſt to be ſaued by them, but rather by the mercy of god. Although queſtionleſſe, they that do not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe good workes, and as much as in them lieth, labour to lead a holy and godly life, ſhall neuer enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of god, nor into the reſt of bleſſed ſoules.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it followeth very well in my text. <hi>The grace of God teacheth vs to deny vngodlineſſe and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts.</hi> Which are nothing elſe but the workes of the fleſh, which cannot agrée, or at leſtwiſe ought not to be ſéene in them that are ſanctified by the grace of God. Theſe worldly luſts and workes of the fleſh, are ſuch, that no man can be ignorant of, and they are too too manifeſt. Which are as the Apoſtle reckneth them vp, adultery, fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vncleannes, wantonnes, idolatry, witcheraft, hatred, debate, emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wrath, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention, ſeditions, hereſies, enuy, murthers, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, gluttony, and ſuch like. Whereof ſaith he, I tolde you before, as I alſo haue told you before, that they which do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the kingdom of god. For the performance of our inordinate affections and euil concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences, the wrath of god commeth. If we be led by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> works of the fleſh, we ſhall die the death. Well are they called in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> 4. 22. Deceiueable luſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deceiue vs in the end. In the beginning is ioy and pleaſure, but in the end, is deſtruction. According as we reade, <hi>Prou.</hi> 14. 12. There is a way which ſéemeth right to a man, but the iſſues therof, are the waies of death. Let euery one of vs thinke, that the grace of god dooth thus perſwade vs, that foraſmuch as Chriſt hath ſuffered for vs in the fleſh, wee ſhould arme our ſelues with the ſame minde, as to mortifie the déeds of the fleſh, and to ceaſe from ſinne. That hencefoorth wee ſhould liue as much time as remaineth in the fleſh, not after the luſts of men, but after the will of god. For it is ſufficient, and more then ſhould haue béene, that wee haue ſpent the time paſt, as the wicked doo in this world. Wherein it will
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:7821:195"/>
ſéeme ſtraunge to them, that we runne not with them vnto the ſame exceſſe of riot. And therefore they wil not ſpare to ſpeake euill of vs, to defame vs, and to caſt out many ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt vs. Wherein let vs be patient, and referre the matter to God, they ſhall anſwere for their ill deeds, and giue accounts to him that is readie to iudge them. All the puniſhments of this life, death, and death again in another world, the ſeuere iudgement of God, who is it that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſparke of grace, that will not relent and haue remorce? that will not now learne to deny their worldly luſts, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it ſhall coſt them deare? Who in this life would leape into the ſea knowing he ſhall be drowned? Who is it that would throw himſelfe into the fire, knowing that he ſhall be conſumed? All worldly luſts, are vnderſtood by the vncleanneſſe of the fleſh, becauſe principally and aboue the reſt, we are giuen thereunto. And therefore 1. <hi>Theſſ. 4. 3. <hi>This is the will of God, euen our ſanctification, and that we ſhould abſtaine from fornication.</hi>
                        </hi> That cuerie one of vs ſhould know how to poſſeſſe his veſſell, that is his bodie, in holineſſe &amp; honour, and not in the luſt of concupiſcence, euen as the Gentiles, and Heathen, and wicked perſons, which know not God. 1. <hi>Cor. 3. 16. <hi>Know ye not that we are the Temple of God, and that the ſpirit of God dwelleth in vs?</hi>
                        </hi> If any of vs deſtroy the temple of God, him ſhall God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. For the temple of God is holy, which we are. For our ſoules, our hearts, and conſciences, are the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſhould dwell. They that follow their worldly luſts, and delight in the workes of the fleſh and are led by them, it is a token that they are paſt grace, and that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered them vp to a reprobate minde. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. So when we do refraine and frame our ſelues another way, it is a token that gods grace doth worke with vs. And that we may ſay as the Apoſtle, that no fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, buggerers, théeues, railers, extortioners, ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the kingdome of God. And ſuch were ſome of vs, yea ſuch by nature are we all, and who can ſay, that either he is
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:7821:195"/>
not, or at leaſtwiſe was not in the number? So that if it be otherwiſe, we are waſhed, we are ſanctied, and made clean, in the name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by the ſpirite of our gracious God, who ſendeth his grace into our hearts. For ſuch is the vertue of that ſpiritual fellowſhip which we haue with Chriſt, that as the ſoule naturally ioyned to the bodie, bringeth forth her effects, ſo Chriſt dwelling in vs by faith, and by the holy Ghoſt, after a ſpirituall maner, and by a ſpirituall vertue, doth ſhew his power in vs, to inable vs to reſiſt ſinne, and to bridle the corrupt deſires of the fleſh. Chriſt by his death hath abated the power of ſinne, that it can no longer be rancke in vs, to do what we wil, but dooth by little and little die, vntill it be waſted and worne away. For as when y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hart of a man hath receiued a deadly wound, he is accounted for dead, although he liue a while, becauſe he cannot eſcape death; ſo ſinne in the death of Chriſt, hath receiued a deadly wound. And by reaſon of that neare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, which by faith we haue with Chriſt, we are ſaid to be dead with him vnto ſinne. <hi>I beſeech you therfore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>by the mercies of God, that you giue vp your bodies a liuing ſacrifice, holy and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God.</hi>
                        </hi> As indéed it cannot be, that where the grace of God doth worke effectually, but that we ſhould deny our worldly luſts, or at leaſtwiſe, by little and little cauſe them to die in vs. They who by a true faith laie holde of Chriſt and his merits, and do apply vnto themſelues the death of Chriſt with all his benefits, are alſo deſirous to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues acceptable vnto god. For they that by the grace of god are made righteous, by the ſame grace are alſo made holy, ſéeing that Chriſt is made vnto vs, both righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, as we read, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Holineſſe is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequent of the grace of god, whereby they that are truly touched, in all thankfull ſort ſhewe themſelues to god, and doo approue themſelues vnto him, in all vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and innocencie of life. Our minds, our hearts, our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and diſpoſitions, the bodie &amp; all the actions thereof
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:7821:196"/>
now are chaunged, the whole man, is nowe framed to a new man, as though he were caſt in a new mould. World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, haue their warning to be packing, and to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to exile and baniſhment, and now are good and godly waies imbraced. The féeling of ſinne, and their former euill life, bréedes a hatred thereof, and the loue of God, of vertue and goodneſſe, which are arguments and tokens of Gods good grace, begin to haue the vpper hand. And howe ioyfull a thing is it, for him that by ſickneſſe was almoſt brought to his death, to come to health and enioy life. A life in ſinne, is but a ſicke life, a languiſhing life, and death it ſelfe; ſo that when we leaue it, and the cuſtome thereof, we riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as it were from the nethermoſt pit, &amp; clap our hands for ioy, that we ſée life, before we were vtterly dead. And herehence, followeth a true amendment of our life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we dedicate, &amp; giue our ſelues to the ſeruice of God, as in time paſt we gaue our ſelues to the ſeruice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel; now righteouſneſſe &amp; holineſſe is our delight, where before we ſerued ſinne &amp; iniquitie. They, who by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God are brought ſo farre, as to deny their worldly luſts, they do dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more, hate and flie from their ſinnes, as from a ſerpent which would ſting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death. Yea, there is alſo a ſorrow in their mindes, that they haue ſo highly diſpleaſed &amp; offended god. Which their ſorrow, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle doth liuely expreſſe. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. For behold ſaith he this thing, that ye haue bene godly ſorry, what great care it hath wrought in you? yea what indignation? yea what feare? yea, howe greate deſire? yea, what zeale? yea, what puniſhment? Yea, then ſhall we knowe and féele alſo the working of Gods grace, in denying our worldly luſts, when there is a true ſorrow according to God in our hearts &amp; conſciences, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing which we know to be forbidden by God, yea the leaſt matters, as all light oathes, idle wordes, profitable lies, or vaine actions; and when we féele a ſtudy and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour in our ſelues, to auoid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt motions that créepe in our mindes. When there is a clearing of ourſelues from all
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:7821:196"/>
ſuſpition, by auoiding all appearance of euil, when there is an indignation and anger for al ſuch things paſt, and a fear, leſt through our corruption they ſhould fal out again, when there is a great deſire to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them, a zeale againſt them, and a puniſhing of them, by exerciſing all due authoritie which God hath giuen vs againſt ſinne, and finally, when there is a great deſire in vs, to ſpende all the reſt of our time, not according to the will and commaundements of God. The denying of our worldly luſtes, is nothing but the hatred of our ſinfull waies, which by theſe thrée reaſons, will growe to bee moſte forcible and effectuall in vs.</p>
                     <p>As firſt, if wee conſider that it is the greateſt pleaſure that can be to the diuel, to ſée men and women who were created to the image of God, to delight more in the workes of darkneſſe then of light, and ſo with might and maine as they ſay, to make ſpéede to their owne deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if we conſider what harme ſinne bringeth, and how much it hurteth, not our ſelues only, but others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo through our example.

                     <p>The third and laſt reaſon by the which the hatred of ſin ſhall grow effectuall in vs, is, when we call to minde howe foule and horrible a thing it is, to gréeue the holy ſpirit, who dwelleth as a gueſt within vs, and by the which we are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as it were with a ſure pledge, againſt the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and of the accompliſhment of our ſaluation. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 24. Hereby we know, that god by his grace dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs, euen by his ſanctifying ſpirit which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which teacheth vs to deny vngodlineſſe and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſtes, and to liue <hi>Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly,</hi> in this preſent world.</p>

For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before we were giuen to all exceſſe and riot, following our deſires, in drunkenneſſe, gluttonie, lecherie, in pride and braue apparell, in gathering, &amp; heaping, and couetting other mens goods, in carrying a mind altogither not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with our eſtate, when the grace of God hath fully perſwaded our mindes, to deny all worldly luſts, then wée beginne to frame our mindes to a meane and to a meaſure, knowing that as Gods bleſſing is in the vſe of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo in the abuſe and ſinfull vſing of them, they turne to our curſe, and vnleſſe we amend, to our condemnation.</p>
                     <p>The propertie of our ſinnefull luſts, is in all exceſſe, and<note place="margin">Luſts.</note> therefore it is well ſaid, that they that are bewitched with the diuels temptations, follow their luſts with gréedineſſe, but they whoſe mindes are renued, frame themſelus to a godly meane, and as we ſay, to a golden meane, that is wondrous well and in good ſort, ſoberly. For Sobrietie is nothing elſe, but the right vſe of Gods creatures. Nature is content with a litle, ſobrietie aſketh no more; and when we excéede, nature is ouerpreſſed, ſobrietie is diſgraced, and we in ſo doing, by the iudgements of all, contemned and deſpiſed. Great difference there is, betwixt neceſſitie, and ſuperfluitie, euen as much as betwixt life and death. Who knowes it not, that of drunkenneſſe, gouts &amp; dropſies, and ſuch diſeaſes grow, which make a man loathſom to other, yea to himſelfe, and he is aweary of his life, and ſo at laſt, his painefull and languiſhing daies are cut off, who might haue liued longer many a faire day?

Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie teacheth vs, that meate and drinke was ordained of God for the ſuſtenaunce of our bodies, that we may bee the better able to performe thoſe duties, which God hath appointed to euery one of vs in our vocation, and not to the ſatiſfying of our pleaſures.

The prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> &amp; the apoſtle <hi>S. Paul,</hi> ſéeing the exceſſe of apparell, and this vice of pride more to abound in women, dooth eſpecially note it and rebuke it in them. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay</hi> in his third chapter, ſheweth the vanitie of the women in his daies, and howe God would puniſh theire exceſſiue deſires; his words are theſe. The Lord alſo ſaith, Becauſe the daughters of <hi>Sion</hi> are hautie and walke with ſtretched out neckes and with wandring eies, walking and muſing as they goe, and making a tinkling with theire féete, Therefore ſhall the Lord make the heades of the daughters of <hi>Sion</hi> bald.

No man can be ignorant that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell was ordained to couer our nakedneſſe, to kéepe vs warme, and to preſerue our health, and not to ſhew our bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, or to ſpend our thrift thereon. And becauſe the Apoſtle did perceiue, that women were more faultie herein, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he counſaileth them <hi>1. Tim. 2. 5.</hi> That if they will be accounted to be godly and ſober, that they ſhould lay aſide all brauery, and array themſelues in comely apparel, with ſhamefaſtneſſe &amp; modeſtie, not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearles, or coſtly garments, but as becommeth women that profeſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fear of God, that they ſhuld deck themſelues with good works, and ſhewe their brauerie in their almes, and relieuing thoſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtand in néed. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Pet. 1. Epi. 3. 3.</hi> Likewiſe hath almoſt the ſame words, and giueth a little more light to this perſwaſion. The apparrelling of women, let it not bee ſo much outward ſaieth hée, in
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7821:199"/>
breivered haire, and gold put about, and in glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell. But if they will be commended for their modeſtie and ſobrietie, let the hid man of their hearts be vncorrupt, with a méeke and quiet ſpirit, which is before God a thing much ſet by. And if they delight in braue apparrell, let this be theire apparrell and no other. For euen after this manner in time paſt, did the holy woman which truſted in God tier themſelues, and were ſubiect to their huſbands. A note well put in. And were ſubiect to theire huſbands. For many of them, being too wilfull, and too ſtately, altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the wills of their huſbands, and beyond their huſbands power and abilitie, bring them into debt, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, and make them oftentimes to vſe vnlawful meanes, to maintaine their brauery. Which is a token of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, that they had rather pleaſe the eies of others, then their owne huſbands. For commonly, lewde women are noted by their braue attire. Braue without, and foule within, painted ſepulchers and rotten bones. Better it were, braue within, and comely without, modeſt and ſober, at home and abroad, in euery place.</p>
                     <p>To this warning which is giuen to women to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelues, men alſo ought to haue regard, as where men in other reſpects are warned, there women alſo muſt haue care. For what is ſpoken to the one, is ſpoken to the other alſo. And this moderation here ſpoken of, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Apoſtles and ſeruants of God we are warned, is not in men and women as of themſelues, except the grace of God doth firſt worke it.</p>

God foreſéeing what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance it would worke in the mindes and hearts of his people, if they ſhould build them coſtly houſes, and leſt they ſhould be too much wedded vnto this world, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to dwell in tents that they might be put in minde as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. That héere they haue no dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling places to continue, but are as pilgrims and ſtrangers on the earth. Whereas they that haue all their hope and all their ioy in this world, delight to build gorgious houſes, as though they ſhould neuer die, and call their lands after their own names. What profit had the Canaanites of their goodly houſes, when as others were made the owners. In the 28. chap. of <hi>Deu.</hi> a curſe was fortold and denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that did not feare God, that althogh they built houſes, yet they ſhould not dwell therein. A iuſt iudgement for them that ſpend their goods ſuperſluouſly, whereas they ſhould beſtow them otherwiſe. Stately <hi>Babel</hi> which was purpoſed to be built vp to heauen, was not finiſhed; and I could wiſh that ſuch <hi>Babel</hi> buildings might haue a fall, or ſome gazing impediment, for euery one to behold &amp; to point at, much like to ſuppreſſed Abbies, that the owners might come to ſome ſobrietie, and learne to imploy their wealth and riches, not to honor themſelues, but to honor God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.

                     <p>Sobrietie alſo hath his vſe in withdrawing the minde from the gredie deſire of couetouſnes, where with many are<note place="margin">Couetouſnes.</note> carried away headlong, and thinke they ſhall neuer haue inough. Heaping, and gathering, and ſcraping, much like to the wont or mole, whoſe continuall practiſe is to ſcrape vnder the earth, ſo are their minds earthly, though they were made to be heauenly. Being made the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

of God, they haue made themſelues monſters, their hands turned into nets, their fingers into limetwigs, their heart, and their head, and all the reſt of their bedie being turned into mettall, as though they were hewen out of ſome golden or ſiluer mine. Their mindes being no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then their bodies, a lumpe of clay. The barrein wombe is not ſatiſfied, the earth hath not inough, hell is bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and the minde of the couetous is inſatiable. What a plague is it for vs to be drudges, when we may be free, and to make wealth &amp; riches our maiſters, which ſhould be our ſeruants.

God hath appointed thée to get thy liuing by thy labor, adde therunto thy earneſt praiers, that it would pleaſe God to bleſſe thy labour, ſo ſhal not couetouſneſſe like a hungry diuel enter within thée and poſſeſſe thée. For if thou haſt inough, what néedeſt thou to haue more? Then ſhall God ſend downe his grace to endue thy mind with ſobrietie, when once thou haſt learned y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> god hath inough for vs all. And as ſobrietie giueth a leſſon to the poore to content themſelues with that portion which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord hath ſent them, ſo alſo may the rich hold themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and remember that they haue their bounds appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and the to acquaint their affections, to finde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation and a moderate ſufficiencie, which is a rich por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So ſhall they truly according to their bounden dutie, be thankfull to God for the ſame. For in very déed, theſe hearts of ours, muſt finde them in their owne perſwaſion prouided for, ere they ſhall in truth and vnfainedneſſe bee ioyfull in the Lord. It is not couetouſneſſe that can kéepe thée from pouertie, if God laie his hand vpon thée, neither can it make thée rich, if God hath otherwiſe ordained. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the bleſſing of God it maketh rich, and he addeth no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row vnto it. All things fall out vnto the beſt vnto the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, come wealth, come woe, come pouertie, come riches. The rich muſt learne to bee poore, and with contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart to vndergo a poore eſtate, yea to aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to finde the Lords bleſſing and comfort in it. Frame and acquaint thy minde alwaies to the liking of a lower eſtate. Behold a meditation in riches, and a leſſon that is of all men to be ſtudied, and not that only but perfectly learned alſo, and throughly taken out, that if their eſtate ſhould yet be poorer, they ſhould perſwade themſelues to finde the Lord good vnto them in that their condition. And therfore before we ſhould make our reckoning of it by much meditation, and yet therein notwithſtanding to finde a rich bleſſing, euen a quiet and contented minde. And this would further the account of our preſent eſtate, if wee ſhould
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:7821:201"/>
aſſure our ſelues to bee in good caſe if our eſtate were yet lower. Neither ought we ſo to learne this as a leſſon, not likely to come to practiſe, but euen ſo as the practiſe thereof were not like long to be deferred. That we may be alwaies readie to ſay with S. <hi>Paule, <hi>Phil.</hi>
                        </hi> 4. (though heretofore it could neuer ſinke in my heart, yet now hath ſobrietie the the gift of Gods good grace taught mee) and nowe I haue learned to be rich and to bee poore, to abounde, and to haue want, and in what ſtate it ſhall pleaſe God to place me in, therewith to bee content. For a minde truly contented, wherein ſobrietie hath taken vp her ſeate, eſtéemeth as well of pouertie as of riches. This leſſon hath in it a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie neceſſary vſe to trie vs by. For whatſoeuer he be that cannot beare a lowe eſtate laide vppon him by the Lorde, if hée haue a higher, hée will abuſe that in like manner. For hée that is aſhamed of pouertie, will bee proude of wealth, and hée that is vnpatient when he is humbled, will be inſolent when he is exalted. And what can bind him to true dutie, if it be not conſcience vnto God? Which if hée dare diſpence withall in pouertie, he will not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarde it in aboundance. Thus we ſée for a man to learne to bee riche, it is expedient hée learne to bee poore.</p>
                     <p>This Sobrietie then that kéepeth the mind from being ouercharged with the deſire of wealth and riches, is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally and chiefly required in a Chriſtian; yea it reacheth further, &amp; conteineth within it y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kinde of people, who albeit they be not greatly ſéeking after another or better eſtate, yet be they too much wrapped &amp; intangled in the cares and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they preſently poſſeſſe.

Which remedie, he would haue to ſeaſon our ioy, to ceaſon our delights, and to moderate our preſent eſtate.

And howe needfull it is, that we ſhould euen in lawfull things, haue our affections temperate, the parable in <hi>Luke.</hi> 14. apparantlie declare. Lawefull it is to buy a farme, to proue oxen, to marry, and to be married, the ouermuch care and delight in theſe thinges, kéept vs from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. How expedient therefore and neceſſary, is ſobrietie, which keepeth vs from ſurfetting of theſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory things. And euen as ſault which ſeaſoneth euerie meate, ſo is ſobrietie the moderatour of the whole courſe of our liues, and the actions thereof. If this will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine vs, from our intangling delightes, let vs call to minde the watchword which is giuen vs by our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Luke.</hi> 21.

The ſeruant would be a maiſter, the ſubiect would be a magiſtrate, the poore grudge, that they are not as well able to liue as the rich. The prouerbe is, that no man liues content with his eſtate, ſo rare it is to ſée men ſtaied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their miuds are fickle. Many will giue out that they are content with their eſtate, becauſe of neceſſitie it falleth out ſo, yet are their mindes and inward hearts, like the waues of the ſea that faine would ouerflowe. What may be the cauſe of robberies, murthers, outrages, miſchiefes, but the want of a mind contented? Wherefore are lawes

made, if not to reſtraine them which liue without a lawe. I haue bene yoong and now am old ſaith the prophet, and yet ſawe I neuer the righteous forſaken, becauſe they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued contented with theire eſtate. Diſcontented people, are lighly ſuch that neuer can be pleaſed, and ſuch that cannot ſatiſfie themſelues, who caſt themſelues into diuers miſeries, becauſe they thinke they can neuer bee well i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Lucifer could not think himſelfe wel, when he was an Angell, vntill through his buſie head, being caſt into hell, it repented him that he was not contented. <hi>Adam and Eue</hi> they were as ſaintes, and yet they would be gods, but their climing minds did bereaue them of their happines and brought them to a curſed eſtate. Well are ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called malecontents; for their contentment ſtandeth in being not content. Troubled heads, euill ſubiects, deſperate traitors, poore purſes, proud hearts, miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous théeues, beggerly gentlemen, toſſepot ruffians, and raunging rouers, a litle time they haue, and full ill they ſpend it, their diſcontented mindes running vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, for the moſt parte a ſhamefull death they come vnto, and had I wiſt, comes neuer into their mindes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late, to teach other to beware, and to kéepe themſelues in compaſſe. Let ſobrietie therefore bee our ſchoolemaiſter, and let vs learne betime to be content with our eſtate, and to hold that as a certaine rule, let vs not be likened to drunken men that ſtagger too and fro, and which are not in their right ſences, to beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpright. For he that hath no ſure rule nor ſtay, ſhalbe ſo toſſed of his affections, and ſo caried hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he ſhall neuer finde a time to ſay, it behoueth me to hold my ſelfe here within my bounds. Well it were, if eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one could take vp good liking of theire preſent eſtate, and let vs take héede, that we be not forgetfull to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God in this reſpect, while the vnquiet deſire of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing our condition, may ſteale all comfort from vs, which comfort, muſt be the matter of true thankfulnes.

that euerie one of vs were ſo ſetled, and ſo ſtaied, and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded, that we could truly ſay vnto our hearts. This is thy lot appointed thée of the Lord, héere are thy bounds, this eſtate hath the Lord diſtributed vnto thée. There is good cauſe not only to be content, but alſo moſt glad with it. We muſt learne our hearts to bee content with it, nay to take it as a rich and liberall portion what euer it be, and as a barre to hold in our affections from raunging into grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die deſire. For our affections are as gulfes that are moſt inſatiable, which would neuer reſt, with contentation in any thing, but ſtill be inflamed with the deſire of more, and drawe and hale vs forward, and ſo hold vs in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all torment. The remedie whereof, the Lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our owne eſtate to be, whatſoeuer it is, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe our affections, and ſettle them with reſt, peace, and good liking, as in the ſeate which our good God hath ſéene to be conuenient for vs, and therefore hath ſet vs in it, to finde eaſe, quiet, comfort, and contentment therein. For if thine heart be not ſetled in thine eſtate with good liking and contentation, as in a good prouiſion, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that euer thou ſhouldeſt become thankfull for it. For to ſéeme to ioy without ioy, is to play the hipocrite, and to diſſemble with God. Now if there be any of vs, who are ſo loaden with infirmities, and ouercome of their owne weakeneſſe, that this godly ſobrietie cannot take place in euerie reſpect as it ought, let him or them become earneſt ſutors vnto the Lord, to preuaile againſt their corruption, which dooth ſo abounde, that it cannot, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will of it owne accord, entertaine ſobrietie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation. And let them bee well aſſured, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained petition and praier of them that are ſo loaden with the burthen of their wants, their praiers being continued, cannot returne emptie from that God, who by name calleth out ſuch to come vnto him, with promiſe that he will heare him and them whoſoeuer. For he that hath begunne this grace within them, will alſo in good time make it perfect.

For the grace of God cannot be without his true effects. To liue righteouſly, is ſo to order our life, as euery man may haue his owne at our hands, for iuſtice and equitie, is a vertue, that giueth to euery one his due. This vertue, doth firſt and principally touch Kings &amp; Princes, Magiſtrates, Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Lawiers, whome God hath made the Lordes and Rulers of right, and to miniſter true iuſtice vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Secondarily and more nearly, it concerneth euery one particulerly, and namely, by this generall rule of Right; that we ſhould wiſh and do to euery one, as we would that<note place="margin">King.</note> other ſhould wiſh and do to vs. The King and Prince in a realme, ought chiefly to take care, that he make and ordain no lawes, wherby his ſubiects ſhould be iniured and wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and that it may be ſaid of him as it was of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ruled the people committed to his charge, prudently, with all his power. And that the King might deale vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore God commanded, that his lawe ſhould be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a booke, that the King might haue it alwaies before his eies, and that in ruling well and vprightly, he might proſper. According to that we reade, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. concerning the King <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> Shalt thou raigne ſaith the Prophet to <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> becauſe thou cloſeſt thy ſelfe in Cedar? Did not thy father eate, drinke, and proſper, when he executed iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and iudgement? when he iudged the cauſe of the poore, he proſpered. Was not this becauſe he knew me ſaith the Lord? But thy eies and thy heart, are only for couetouſnes and for oppreſſion. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of <hi>Iehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,</hi>

he ſhall be buried as an aſſe is buried. <hi>Prou.</hi> 20. 8. A King that ſitteth in the throne of iudgement, chaſeth away all euill with his eies. The care of iuſtice ſhall preſerue the King, and eſtabliſh him in his throne. For a King by iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maintaineth the countrey, (<hi>Prou.</hi> 29. 4.) yea ſo much the more ought the King to haue care hereof, becauſe his whole land ſhall be puniſhed for the want of it; as where it is vſed, the land ſhall proſper the better for it. Iuſtice and iudgement, they are the ſtrong holdes and fenced places of the land, they are the keies of the country, and they kéep vs better, then all the block-houſes or places of defence wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. They are better able to encounter with our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then any garriſon of men, how well practiſed or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſoeuer they may be. But contrariwiſe, the neglect of iuſtice, is worſe then rebellion, it pulleth Princes out of their throanes, maketh the land caſt out her inhabitants, ioyneth with forreine power, openeth the gates of all our caſtles and holds, taketh the weapon from the warriour, the heart from the valiant ſouldier, wiſedom and forecaſt from the wiſe counſailour, and poiſoneth al our munition. What is it for Kings and Princes, to take care for a mightie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, or a valiant army, or forcaſtles and bulwarkes, for ſhot and ordinance? if Gods ordinances bee not fulfilled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and iuſtice and equitie be not executed in the land? For God can giue ouer a great number into the hands of a fewe, and make things impoſſible, ſéeme very eaſie.</p>
                     <p>Next to the King and Prince, are they to looke to the<note place="margin">Iudge.</note> due miniſtration of iuſtice, whom the King doth put in his place, and whom he doth put in truſt to ſee all things right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed. That they may haue regarde to bee men of courage, to feare God, to deale truly, and to hate couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Yea ſuch as that godly King <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> would haue to be vnder him, as we reade, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 19. whom he did vnto his great commendation, worthily exhort vnto their dutie, that through the counſaile and countenance of the King, they might haue heart to do it. And he ſaid to the Iudges,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:7821:204"/>
whom he had ſet in the land throughout all the ſtrong cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, citie by citie. Take héed what ye do, for ye execute not the iudgements of man, but of the Lord; and he wil be with you in the cauſe &amp; iudgement. Wherefore now let the feare of the Lord be vpon you, take héed and do it, for there is no iniquitie with the Lord our God, neither reſpect of perſons, nor receiuing of reward. That the Iudges ſhould not be danted or corrupted, they know, ſéeing they are men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend grauitie and great wiſedome, that they beare the perſon of the King, as though the King himſelfe were there in preſence. The Princes armes are hung ouer them, the beſt of the ſhire do homage and reuerence vnto them, they countenance them out before the people, the Sheriffe wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vppon them with all his power. Yea more then this, God hath appointed them in his ſeate, and calleth them by his owne name, <hi>Gods,</hi> that they may be put in minde, that God in all rightfull cauſes, will maintaine them, defend them, and ſtand with them. But if they ſwarue, they muſt remember, that the preſence of God is no ſmall matter, who hath made notable men offending, notable examples alſo of his wrath. As it is in the Pſalme. And he ſmote downe the choſen men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> famous and men of renowme. The preſence of God is about them, to giue them honour, and to defend them; but if they do otherwiſe then well, to depoſe them, and to diſpoſſeſſe them, both of their liues, and of their honors. Againe, that they ſhould not be corrupted, the King and crowne, hath graunted them a moſt large and liberall penſion, to the end that gifts &amp; bribes ſhould not blind their eies, nor peruert true iudgement. And becauſe God is the God of iuſtice and iudgement, and righteouſnes, therfore he hath regard &amp; is mindfull of the Iudges, and let them think with themſelues &amp; alſo be fully perſwaded, that this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.

He is the liuing land-marke, which by true opening of the lawes, boundeth euery man within the compaſſe of his own title. And becauſe of that, doth highly deſerue of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wealth, as a moſt neceſſary and profitable member thereof.

That when he is incombred for that which of right belongeth vnto him, they ſhould out of that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure houſe of the lawe, bring good euidence for him, and ſo foorthwith cleare his innocency. The lawe is the houſe of euery man, who being toſſed with many ſtormes abroad, he findeth a place to hide his head in, and being in ſafetie, dooth boldly contemne both winde and weather, and alſo quietly take his reſt.

The hurt in like manner is excéeding great, where the feare of God dooth not rule. For is it not a maruellous miſchiefe, to remoue the land-marke of any man?

Euery man will grant, that if a man of no conſcience, had the cuſtodie of all the

And is not this performed, while the law is made to ſpeak, that which they knew in truth it did neuer meane, as alſo to bury that in ſilence, which it was appointed to giue teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and witneſſe vnto? And if all this were nothing, what can be ſo miſerable, as when a man hath bene all the day abroad in the ſtormes and tempeſts, at night when he commeth home, to finde his houſe in that caſe, that it can hold out neither winde nor raine? And do not many who are forced by reaſon of the ſtormes and tempeſts abroad, to betake them to this their houſe and harbour, I meane the lawe, finde the tempeſt often, as gréeuous there, as before they did in the plain? Would to God there were none tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of their owne doores in the midſt of the ſtorm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope at all of harbour from thence? Or if a man that had bene dogged to his owne doores by théeues, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten his houſe vpon his head, beginneth to breathe himſelfe, and to reioyce for his good eſcape, thinking all to be ſafe, and ſuſpecting no harme, who could ſufficiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile him, if in the midſt of his triumph, they be founde in his owne houſe, that fall vpon him and murther him? And is not the lawe the houſe of the troubled and vexed man? Yea <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> is the poore mans houſe.

For why? the man hath right and title in his good cauſe, vnto as ſpéedie a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pdtch at your hands, as poſſibly may be had. And therefore <hi>Iob</hi> profeſſed (<hi>Iob.</hi> 31. 16.) that he had wearied the eies of the widow, with waiting long for helpe before it came. It is a true ſaying of the Heathen man; He doubleth his gift, that giueth it ſpéedily.

It is our part therefore to pray for our Magiſtrates and thoſe that be in place of iuſtice, that they may looke to the cauſe of the widow, fatherleſſe and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that they may purge the land of blood, by taking pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> male factors, that they may haue courage and the feare of God, and that they may hate couetouſneſſe.

                     <p>Thus ye haue heard generally, what is meant by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">Euery one particularly to another.</note> righteouſly, being ſet downe in the duties of them to whom principally it pertaineth. Secondarily &amp; more néerly, it toucheth the ſtate of euery one particularly. For we are all of vs ſeuerally &amp; particularly to deale righteouſly with our brethren, in all our conuerſation with them, whereby we ſhould declare the loue we beare vnto them. And the Lord hath appointed vs, not only to ſhewe this loue vnto them, but alſo the things that be deare vnto them, as goods and good name, euen to theſe hath the Lord bounde vs, as well as to their perſons. For wee muſt intermedle one with another, and find ſuccour one from another. And their name and goods by his appointment go through our hands and charge, as well as his perſon, and muſt finde ſuccour there. This is the charge from God, that when any thing of theirs paſſeth through our hands, it finde that affection towards it, which may giue teſtimony of our brotherly good wil to them, and witneſſe our obedience vnto God. And the ſame God that forbiddeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murther of his bodie, forbiddeth alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtealth of his goods. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hath bound our loue &amp; good affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer to his body, hath in like maner done it towards his goods. Hardly ſhall any man be perſwaded, that he is louing vnto him, who is impairing him in any thing that is deare vnto him, alwaies gaining by his loſſe. The poore man, whoſe mony muſt paſſe through the hands of the merchant, the farmer, the draper, mercer, and ſuch like, by that time that euery one ouerſelling his commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a fliece, he bringeth the ſweat of his brows, that is his blood, which he hath plenteouſly powred out, and made no ſpare of it throughout the whole yeare, into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row roome. Neither can he giue a true report, of any loue he founde at their handes, more then one might finde at
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:7821:206"/>
the hand of a Turke or Infidell. In the 25. chapter of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticus, the people of God are charged, not to oppreſſe one an other in buying and ſelling. Wherein the lawe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and equitie ſhould be ſhewed, ſo that a man ſhould not too much regarde himſelfe only and his owne commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, but alſo the eſtate and welfare of an other. By which commandement of God it is apparant, that it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a man to take whatſoeuer he could get, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what a bargain his neighbour was like to haue at his hands. We are exhorted by the Apoſtle, to make conſcience of ſuch matters, in the 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. Let no man oppreſſe or defraud his brother in anything, for euen the Lord is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger of ſuch things. Know ye not ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that the vnrighteous ſhall not inherite the kingdome of God. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. And what right hath any man to another mans money, not giuing him the value or woorth of it, in wares or merchandiſe? Be not deceiued ſaith the holy Ghoſt, in the ſame place, neither théeues, couetous perſons, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, ſhall inherite the kingdome of God.

When not only his owne thoughts, but euen his owne words alſo, doo oftentimes condemne his dealing, both of iniury and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. Better it were for vs, if our conſcience were more vpright. For our carefull walking in the waies of righteouſneſſe, haue plentifull promiſes of bleſſings from the Lord. So that if his word be of any credit with vs, we may be well aſſured, that by ſuch dealings our gaines will growe to be the greateſt.

and glory. And 28. 20. A faithfull man ſhall abound in bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. But let vs marke what followeth; But he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth haſte to be rich, ſhall not be innocent. Noting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that ſuddaine wealth and riches, lightly commeth neuer by honeſt dealing, but for the moſt part, by iniury and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, whereby although they be rich and wealthie, yet are they hated.</p>
                     <p>The order that is here obſerued in the text, may in no wiſe be neglected; For ſobrietie is ſet before righteouſneſſe in this place. <hi>We muſt liue ſoberly and righteouſly,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Without ſobrietie and temperance, righteous and iuſt dealing, cannot be holden vp and mainteined. For if a man haue not learned to be rich and to be poore, he ſhall neuer hold out the courſe of iuſtice and righteous dealing. He ſhall neuer buy and ſell with conſcience, that hath not accounted with himſelfe to carry a lowe ſaile, and lower then he hath done, if God ſée it good ſo. The faſhion of the world is, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matter lieth vpon the loſſe of fauour, credit, wealth, or countenance, then conſcience, and equitie, and iuſtice, and righteous dealing, is ſtretched out &amp; made to ſerue, where it ſhould not. Sobrietie is baniſhed, where righteous dealing cannot take place. For if we could be contented to be humbled in the worlde, if God could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be ſerued, or a good conſcience maintained, wée ſhould haue more power to doo iuſtice, and to liue vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our calling whatſoeuer. But while we are ſo drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in profits, pleaſures, and honours in the world, we are neuer put to any ſtrait, but we muſt borrow an ace and go beyond compaſſe. Let vs imbrace temperance and ſobrietie, and ſo ſhall iuſtice and righteouſneſſe ſhine in our dealings, and God ſhall be glorified in our conuerſation. Many good lawes are made to cauſe vs to liue iuſtly one with another, but little fruite of them, and our vnrighteous dealing is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the lawes, becauſe it preuaileth more. And againe our exceſſe, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roote of vnrighteous dealing, is not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. For why? we haue taken ſo large a meaſure of port
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7821:207"/>
and countenance, being void of ſobrietie, that the cloth of righteous dealing muſt néedes be cut thereafter. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie that pleaſed our fathers, in attire, in faire port and moderate couutenance, will not ſerue our turne; their meaſure will not ſerue vs, who are growne out of meaſure. This makes rentes to bee raiſed, reuenewes to be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the prices of wares augmented, our paines dearer, our gifts greater, our pleaſuring of men better conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and more rewarded; our liberalitie to the poore or to any good purpoſe leſſened, our compaſſion abated, and ſo our fathers good report altered in vs, and altogither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied. Let euerie man taſte more of temperance and ſobrietie, and ſo ſhall he be able to affoord a better penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth of righteous and vpright dealing in his calling.

Too thankfull we cannot be, becauſe we can neuer make recompence. According to that the Apoſtle ſaith; In all things giue thanks.

There is none of vs all that brought any thing into the world, and certaine it is, we ſhall carrie nothing out. Therefore we may find our ſelues well contented, if we haue foode and raiment, wherewithall to ſerue our turne. But if this will not ſerue, marke what may followe. They that will be rich, they fall into temptations &amp; ſnares, and into manie fooliſh and noyſome luſts, which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction. Remember who it was that ſaid; All theſe will I giue thée, if thou wilt fall downe and worſhip me. He that maketh gold his God, ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be beguiled. As deſtruction often followeth the great deſire of riches, ſo godlineſſe which is ſéene in contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the high way vnto ſaluation. They that are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, haue many cares, and deſires, and troubles, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to hinder them from God and godlineſſe. Of all which cares, troubles, deſires, and vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they are diſbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, which carry co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented minds, and moſt frée they are by that meanes vnto the ſeruice of God.

Charge them that are riche ſaith the Apoſtle, that they truſt not in their vncertaine riches, but in the liuing God, who giueth vs aboundantly all thinges to enioy. And yet his charge ſtretcheth further, that is, that they ſhould doo good, and be rich in good workes, and readie to diſtribute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and giue to others. And this is the gaine that bringeth godlineſſe with it, and this godlineſſe hath great gaine. For thereby, we laie vp in ſtore a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the time to come. And hée that ſo laieth out his goods, giueth them not to the poore but vnto GOD.

godlineſſe exhorteth to take it patiently, not grudging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to ſay, as God hath taken, ſo God may giue, and forgiue mée my ſinnes, and reſtore vnto mée againe at pleaſure. If thy enemie hath done thée iniury and wrong, ſay not with the worlde, hée ſhall ſtarue before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue him; hée ſhall bee hanged before I will doo him anie good; but godlineſſe is charitable, and teacheth thée to doo good to thine enemies, that thy enemies heart may bee turned towarde thée, to wiſh thée well, and that god may bleſſe thée. If thy patience be ſéene in thy perſecution and death for gods truth, bleſſed ſhalt thou be, and thy rewarde ſhall bee greate in heauen. As the Apoſtle ſaith; In all thinges giue thanks, becauſe for the moſte part we are forgetfull; ſo alſo may it well bee ſaide; In all thinges bee patient, becauſe our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſuch, and ſo farre from patience.

For all the doubt is in this preſent world, where it is a hard matter for vs to goe upright, and to behaue our ſelues in the feare of God as we ought to do. For the life of man may well be compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the paſſage of a ſhip in the ſea, which through tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous weather may be ouerturned by the mounting waues of the ſea, or torne in pieces by the gunſhot of the enemie, and théeuiſh and miſchieuous pirates, or elſe may be daſht in pieces againſt the rockes, or ſuddainly ſunke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quicke ſands, or vnawares taken within the compaſſe of a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole, and by the force and ſtrength thereof, carried violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the bottome; but after it hath once arriued at the hauen, there is no ſuch doubt, there is no ſuch feare. So is our life in this preſent worlde, ſubiect to many an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, (the life of the bodie I meane not, but the life of the ſoule, whereof we ought to haue eſpeciall care) ſinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs abounding like the force of the enemie, the pirate, or the mounting waues, frailties &amp; infirmities, like the quick ſoft ſands, euill examples of other and their wicked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes, like the daſhing of the rockes, the temptations and ſnares of the diuel, like the force of a whirlepoole, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue vntill we be brought to the bottome. If any of theſe take hold of vs in this preſent world, ſo that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt vs, we are gone. Therefore thrice happie is he who by a godly life can auoyd all theſe, and at laſt arriue at the hauen and take vp his euerlaſting reſt in heauen. Oh that we could be godly and watchfull in this preſent world, for in the world to come, we ſhall haue no hinderance, and nothing to let, but that moſt freely we may ſerue God, and leade a godly life. Let vs pray, that the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt may be with vs, and that it may abound, who gaue himſelfe for the ſacrifice and ſatiſfaction of our ſinnes, that hee might deliuer vs from this preſent euill worlde. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.

And herehence groweth the exhortation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, written to the <hi>Phil.</hi> chapter 2. 15. wherby he warneth them, and vs alſo by them, that we ſhould behaue our ſelues blameleſſe and pure, as the ſonnes of God, without rebuke, and that we ſhould endeuour to ſhine as lights in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wicked world, dwelling in the midſt of naughtie and bad people.

A great comfort we haue, and a great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to be godly, becauſe we are not vnder the lawe, but vnder grace, that is, we are frée from the curſe of the law, that we may the more chearfully giue obedience ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, being furthered &amp; aſſiſted by the grace of God, which ſtrengthneth vs to doo his will. For the lawe is not giuen to the righteous, but to the vnholy and to the prophane. The curſe to the one, and the bleſſing to the other.

How neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therefore is it for euerie one of vs, to prouoke one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to loue and to good workes.

And better it had béene for vs not to haue knowne the way of godlineſſe, then after we haue knowne it to turne away. Rather let vs bee ſtirred vp and incouraged by the words of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter 2. <hi>Epiſt.</hi>

The comming of the glory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great God was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before his eies. The greatneſſe of the thing, and the excellency of it, is noted in theſe wordes.

for, and hepe in due time according to our meaſure, to be partakers of. Moſt worthie it is the waiting for, and great cauſe there is why we ſhould be moued to ſanctification and holineſſe of life, hauing ſo great things in expectation. We beſéech you ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 12. that ye would walk worthie of God, who vouchſafeth to call you vnto his owne kingdome and glory. The glory of this world dazeleth our cies, and therefore muſt we be drawne vp by meditation of greater things, before we ſhal be able to let theſe be of ſmal reckning and account with vs. The greatneſſe of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie once throughly digeſted, would ſet theſe in a baſe and lowe place, it would make the things of this life vaniſh as ſmoake from our preſence. While in minde and inwarde thought we behold and looke, not on the things which are ſéene, but on the things which are not ſéene. For the things which are ſéene, are temporall, but the things which are not ſéene, are eternall. If it be but the expectation of a tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie kingdome, when it is once deuoured and digeſted by hope, we ſée it maketh men neglect liues, goods, landes, friends, wife, and children, and ſo to hazard all. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that is in expectation of ſome great gaine, we ſée in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what vnknowne countries, into what dangers by ſea he wil commit himſelfe. The great regard and care that is had euery where to the things here belowe, the gréedie following after them, the carefull purſuing of pleaſures, profits, and honors, doo plainly ſpeake, that the hope of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life is not yet ſetled in the hearts of a number; and that is the cauſe that godlineſſe and a holy life is ſo litle practiſed and performed. Let vs call to remembrance, how that in this life is our day to wait, and this is our time to ſerue, and we muſt aſſure our ſelues with the holy Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. that we haue fought a good fight againſt our ghoſtly enemies, ſinne, the world, and the diuel, and that we haue led our liues in the feare of God, before we can, or ſhal truly ſay, and our conſcience witneſſe vnto vs, that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth is laide vp for me the crowne of righteouſneſſe. And
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:7821:213"/>
if our conſciences and the good ſpirite of God can warrant our hearts herein, without all doubt and feare, then when Chriſt which is our life ſhall appeare, ſhall be glorious and appeare with him in glory. There is no pleaſure in this world, which the Lord hath not matched with ſome griefe and paine, to take away and remoue (if it might be) our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and to place it in thinges of greater eſtimation, and which ſhalbe more ſure vnto vs. If the glorie of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preuaile againſt vs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The truth is, that we are too much perſwaded of the excellencie of theſe worldly matters, as pleaſures, honours, riches and ſuch like.

And becauſe in the lawe of Moſes, ſacrifices were offered vp for the ſinnes of the people, and beaſtes ſlaine and bloud ſhed, (as we reade <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. All thinges were by the lawe purged with bloud, and without ſhedding of bloud is no remiſſion and forgiueneſſe) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it pleaſed our Sauior Chriſt to ſhed his deareſt bloud, that as the Prophet <hi>Eſay, ca.</hi> 53. ſaith; by his ſtripes we were healed, ſo by his bloud we might be clenſed. Which thing the Prophet Dauid meaneth in his 51. <hi>Pſal.</hi> which is the <hi>Pſalme</hi> of his repentance, wherein he ſheweth his heartie griefe, and his vnfeigned ſorrow for thoſe hainous ſinnes, whereby he had prouoked Gods wrath againſt him. <hi>Haue mercie vpon me O God according to thy louing kindneſſe, according to thy compaſsions put away mine iniquities.

Howe much more ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. ſhall the bloud of Chriſt, that moſt perfect and abſolute ſacrifice, who through the eternall ſpirit, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelfe without ſpot to God, purge your conſciences from dead workes, to ſerue the liuing God. At the time of his death and paſſion this matter was moſt notably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, when as his ſide being pierced through with a ſpeare, there iſſued out from thence both water and bloud; to giue out a moſt effectuall ſignification, that hée was the cauſe of our ſanctification and cleanſing from our ſinnes. Which is prooued by that which we reade. I. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6. <hi>Knowe ye not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous ſhall not inherite the kingdome of God? Be not deceiued, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor buggerers, nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drunkardes, nor railers, nor extortioners ſhall inherite the kingdome of God.</hi> And ſuch were ſome of you, and who can ſay, my heart is cleare? But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified and made cleane in the name of the Lord Ieſus, that is, by the ſhedding of his bloud, and alſo we are ſanctified and made cleane (ſaith hée) by the ſpirite of our God. According to that of the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſalme aforeſaide: Waſh me throughly, and cleanſe me from my ſinne, and eſtabliſh me with thy frée ſpirit, which may aſſure me that I am drawne out of the ſlauery of ſin, and that my guiltineſſe ſhall be no more laid to my charge. The law entred thereupon, that the offence ſhould abound; that is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it might be known to be notorious: neuertheleſſe where ſinne abounded, there grace abounded much more.

That as ſinne had raigned vnto death, ſo might grace alſo raign by righteouſneſſe and ſanctification vnto eternal life, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. The which grace, that is, the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes through the blood of Chriſt, the good ſpirit of God the holy Ghoſt doth certifie vnto our hearts. And therefore it is well ſaid to be the comfortor, as our Sauiour Chriſt promiſed, that after his aſcention vp into heauen, hée would ſend the comfortour. <hi>Ib.</hi> 14. 16. and 16. 7.

Thou néedeſt not in this matter to go farre to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and ſearch it out, only this is required of thée, that thou maieſt ſhewe thy thankfulneſſe, bee zealous of good workes. For we are the workmanſhip of God, eſperially by grace, created anew in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good workes, which God hath ordained that wee ſhould walke in them. Heere are all carnall goſpellers condemned, who liue in hope, that vnder the countenance of their profeſſion, all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of life will be borne out well inough. Who turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe, and make their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion their ſhame, making Chriſt his death to bee nothing elſe, but as it were a boude vnto their lewde life. Here may we ſée, that the Lord hath not laide downe his life, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:7821:215"/>
no other thing at our hands beſides a profeſſion of the truth, but that he bought with his bloud a zealous addicting of our ſelues to Chriſtian conuerſation. It is a wonder to ſée how the wicked will boaſt of the benefite of Chriſt his blood, how mightie it is to merite, how ſufficient to ſaue from ſinne. But for all that, they will not giue ouer any libertie of life, that before they haue enioyed, whereas the life of Chriſt was giuen to purchaſe a new conuerſation, as well as a new profeſſion. For he gaue himſelfe for vs, that we might giue our ſelues vnto him, being a peculiar people, zealous of good workes. Let vs marke it then my brethren, that he gaue himſelfe for vs, that our life might be let out to honour him. He made not ſo ſlender a purchaſe with ſo great a price, as if he had a déep and ſorrowfull ſigh, or a good word at our laſt breath, that would ſuffice him; no, his life was giuen for the purchaſe of a zealous giuing of our liues to thoſe workes. And therefore doth the Apoſtle tell vs, that we are not our owne, as to frame our liues after our owne liking, but we are to ſerue the Lord both with our bodie and with our ſpirite, becauſe they are the Lords, who hath bought them with a price. If we humble not not our ſelues to a zealous following of good works, we withhold the Lords due, for he hath paide a great price, to purchaſe a good life at our hands, and dearly paide for a life ledde in zealous obedience vnto his word. For we are not barely to giue ſome good words, either to ſhewe ſome good countenance towards religion and Chriſtian conuerſation, but to haue our conuerſation declare, that we are affected with the ſame, and become ſtudious of ſuch an eſtate of life. And ſuch are they which declare themſelues to be the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, for whome the Lord laide out his life. As for thoſe who walke ſo indifferently, betwéene true religion and falſe, that a man cannot diſcerne whether they are more inclined vnto, as alſo thoſe that walke ſo euen betwéene a eiuill life and a Chriſtianlike behauiour, that the difference is not eaſily perceiued, they doo declare themſelues as yet
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:7821:216"/>
not to be affected in deſire toward thoſe dueties, which the Lord hath laid vpon his people to performe. Now where this purchaſe of his hath taken place and effect, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a peculiar people, zealous of good workes. And if cold and luke-warme chriſtians, may haue but litle comfort fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death of Chriſt, what ſhall become of them who are ſworne enemies either to true religion, or els to a good life and chriſtian behauiour? It is ſaid here, that we muſt be purged, and ſo the Apoſtle would haue vs to become a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people vnto our God, zealous of good works. Which agreeth with that of S. <hi>Peter 1. Ep.</hi> 2. 9. Ye are a choſen ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, a royall prieſthood, an holy nation, a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the vertues of him that hath called you out of darkeneſſe, into his maruellous light. Which in time paſt were not a people, yet are now the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; which in time paſt were not vnder me rcie, but now haue obteined mercie. He gaue himſelfe to purge vs, which office of purging, the holy ghoſt performeth, not by miracle, but by meanes, as I haue ſaid afore.</p>
                     <p>Which ſpirite of God, pray we that it may ſo worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with his grace in our heartes, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we may be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught, and alſo perſwaded vtterly to deny vngodlineſſe and worldly luſtes, as we haue made a vow and faithfull promiſe thereof in our baptiſme, ſo that we may liue ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without exceſſe and riot, righteouſly without doing iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and wrong, and godly with a care to do all good workes, whereby we may pleaſe God, and liue in fauour and credit among men.

And what though ſome ſhould mocke at vs for our reformed life, and godly and holy conuerſation, (for the diuell will ſtirre vs vp enemies inough) for al ſuch matters we muſt be pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

foorth trembling &amp; feare. And ſo much the more are we in feare, in bondage, and ſlauery, ſubiect to the curſe &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the lawe, to death and gods dreadfull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe we are borne the children of wrath. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſent his natural ſonne Chriſt into the world, that through his grace, he might adopt vnto himſelfe many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vs, which otherwiſe were but miſerable caſtawaies. Who by the grace &amp; frée fauour of God being adopted, haue not only their ſinnes pardoned and forgiuen, but alſo are cladde with the innocencie and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, whereby they are brought into fauoure, and are made of fearefull captiues, being vnder the bondage of ſinne and Sathan, the ioyfull ſonnes and children of God, ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to doo the workes of God, and to liue in his holie obedience. What greater feare can there be to our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, then when this is pronounced againſt vs? <hi>Curſed is hee that continueth not in all the workes of the lawe to doo them.</hi> And he that offendeth in one point of the lawe, is guiltie of all. Who is it amongſt vs all, that can ſay my heart is cleane? And who is it, that cannot iuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne himſelfe in the breach of euery particular point of Gods lawe and of his commandements? And if our heart condemne vs, God is greater then our hearts, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all. Here hence therfore can nothing ariſe but feare, and ſuch a feare which is beyond meaſure, leading vs vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, making vs to thinke no better of our ſelues, then as miſerable wretches, forlorne &amp; deſtitute of all comfort, as <hi>Cain</hi> was, who in fearful ſort went alwaies mourning and crying out, ſaying; <hi>My ſin is heauier then I can beare.</hi> The puniſhment of God is ſtil vpon me, and my conſcience is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at reſt.

And if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deliuery of the law were ſo fearful, that he that had leaſt cauſe to feare, and was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, did tremble &amp; quake, how much more fearefull

and terrible ſhal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> execution of that law be. <hi>Moſes</hi> the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeruant of God in a fright, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely beloued ſon of God in déep agonies, the one trembleth, the other for anguiſh ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth bloud. And how ſhould not the children of wrath be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed with horror, conſidering our heauy burden of ſin, which bréedeth within vs (eſpecially them that are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched) as it were a ſea of ſorrow, whoſe waues, as they cannot be numbred, ſo are our ſorrowes neuer at an end vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til God ſend fréedome, one waue ſtill ouertaking another, &amp; one feare in the necke of another. Being poſſeſſed with the ſpirite of bondage, how may it be that we may auoid our dolefull dumpes. So is it with them that haue any féeling of that fearefull eſtate y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hangeth ouer their heads. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by nature we are all of vs giuen to wicked waies with gréedineſſe, and are ſo ſubiect to the bondage and ſlauery of the diuell and of ſin, that we thinke no way better then the broad way that leadeth to deſtruction, thinking that heauen is in this world, and that hell is but an old wiues tale, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto our ſelues, Peace, peace, and all is in ſafety, when ſodainly either death ſhall ouertake vs, or the latter day bring vs to iudgement. True it is, that which the eie ſeeth not, the heart rueth not, and the diuell hath diuers deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to blinde the eies of our vnderſtanding, to make vs ſtill to run on, vntill it be too late to turn backe. Being deſtitute of the grace of God, and not as yet regenerate, we are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder the euill ſpirit of bondage, ſetting all our delight in earthly and tranſitorie things, yéelding vp our ſelues to our fleſhly deſires, being ſtrangers from God and ſtrangers from our redéemer, ſtrangers from the life to come, and altogither vnacquainted with his grace. Wherby although we may think, we are in the eſtate of fréedome and as frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet are we of no better account then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baſeſt ſeruants that liue, and againe vnder ſuch a maiſter, whoſe ſeruice is nothing els but tyrannie, ſhaddowed ouer with flattery, a roaring lion ſeeking after his pray, &amp; a gréedy wolfe clothed in a ſhéep ſkin. But as Chriſt came into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to deſtroy
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:7821:220"/>
the workes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel, ſo hath he cauſed his grace to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and ſent his ſpirit into our hearts, to open the eies of our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, to turn our harts, and make them relent, to make vs ſée how cruell our maiſter is whome we ſerue, and how dangerous an eſtate we are in, being nothing but bondage &amp; ſlauery, death &amp; deſtruction. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar effect of the ſpirit of God, and of his grace, to ſhew vs our miſerable eſtate by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of God, to ſtrike our conſciences with the rememembrance of our ſinnes, that we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that we are in a deſperate eſtate, vnleſſe we fly to Chriſt for ſuccor. Wherfore being directed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of god, our ſtubburn harts are made to yéeld, and to ſhed abundance of teares, in conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue offended God. Which ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of fréedom, prouoketh vs to flie vnto Chriſt our only ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, &amp; by a ſtedfaſt faith, to take hold of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſes of gods mercy, through the death of Chriſt, whereby it commeth to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> our ſins are forgiuen, and although we are vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy therof, are we accounted &amp; numbred among the children of God. This is that ſpirit of adoption, that maketh vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce vnder the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of GOD. Which maketh our ioy ſo much the more aboundant, in conſideration of our fearefull eſtate, whereby we were ſo miſerable. So that wee may boldly triumph with the Apoſtle, ſaying; <hi>Reioyee in the Lord alwaies, and againe I ſay reioyce.</hi> For what greater ioy can there be, then the ioy and peace of a quiet conſcience, being fully reſolued of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and of the fauoure of God, who hath aduanced vs to ſo high a dignitie, as of his enemies to make vs his ſonnes and children. Wherefore in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of our former eſtate, let vs follow the Apoſtles counſaile, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. Paſſe the time of your dwelling here in feare, and liue not careleſly, as thongh we might doe what we liſt, much like to wanton children, which had néed continually to be corrected with the rod. But as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, Brethren be not children in vnderſtanding, but as concerning maliciouſneſſe be children, but in vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:7821:221"/>
be of a ripe age; ſo manie I ſay brethren as concerning wickedneſſe and vngodly behauiour, let vs be children, but as concerning the feare of God, let vs grow from ſtrength to ſtrength, vntill we be of a ripe age. A dutifull ſeruaunt ſtandeth alwaies in feare and diſtruſt, that that which he doth to his maiſter be not perfitly and ſufficiently done, as one deſirous to continue his maiſters fauour and good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king toward him. So alſo a dutifull child, ſhould be careful ſtill to pleaſe his father, for feare not onely of looſing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good wil, but alſo of hindering himſelfe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which otherwiſe his father would leaue him and do for him. How much more ſhould an adopted child looke vnto himſelfe and to his waies, becauſe he is taken in but of fauour without any deſert, and onely vpon pitie and compaſſion, rather then vpon any other conſideration. Wherefore it is not for vs to make a triumph of our adoption, and to make our boaſt and vaunt of it, but rather in a godly ſort to humble our ſelues through feare, forecaſting with our ſelues how to continue Gods good will toward vs, which through our negligence and careleſſe behauiour may be remooued. For as they that come to goods, to landes, and poſſeſſions, by fauour &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and by adoption, through their own fooliſhnes may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe themſelues of all: ſo if a godly wiſdome be not vſed, the benefit of adoption may greatly be diſgraced in vs, and we may bring our ſelues into that caſe, as iuſtly to thinke that we are none of Gods children. So did that godly king <hi>Dauid,</hi> and that holy bleſſed Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> by their infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſinnes, ſo alter the certaintie of their adoption, as though they had quite béen forſaken of God. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it is not without great cauſe, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle vſeth theſe words; Let him y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtandeth, take héed leaſt he fall. As if he had ſaid, let the adopted children of God take héed, leſt they offend God, and let the teſtimony of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, be alwaies a reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing vnto them, and that the certaintie of our adoption may alwaies be warranted vnto vs. Where is therefore our ioy, or where is our chiefeſt care grounded and ſetled?

And ſo much the more, becauſe we ſhalbe void of all excuſe, knowing what is well pleaſing to God, and alſo what is deteſtable in his ſight, and yet forſaking the right hand and taking the left; I meane refuſing that which is good, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the way which leadeth to deſtruction. We which by nature were the grafts of the wilde oliue trée, I meane the children of Gods wrath, are by a ſupernaturall working and moſt wonderfull fauour, grafted into the right and true oliue, and by adoption and grace, made and accounted the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:7821:222"/>
children of God. And ſéeing by grace and fauour thou ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt &amp; art accepted, be not high minded, but feare; boaſt not thy ſelf of Gods gift, which is giuen vnto thée through faith in Ieſus Chriſt, but rather ſhewe thy ſelfe mindfull &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his benefit, hauing the feare of God alwaies before thy eies, to kéep thée fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all euil waies. Why thou wilt ſay, if God hath made me his childe, and adopted me through faith in Chriſt, I ſhall neuer do amiſſe. But know, that our life in this world is but a triall, and that it is as a caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet &amp; beſieged with many enemies, and if in this life &amp; al thy life, thou do not hold on a good courſe, and perſeuere &amp; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue therin vnto thy end, thy great perſwaſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignitie, as to be called &amp; accounted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child of God, may faile, and all thy ſafetie, and all thy reioycing, may be nothing elſe, but as the prouerbe is, A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For if God ſpared not the Angels, which kept not their firſt eſtate, but hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them in euerlaſting chaines vnder darkneſſe, vnto the iudgement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great day, how ſhall we think to be ſpared, if we abuſe Gods bleſſing of adoption, turning the grace of God into wantonneſſe, and inſtéed of obedient children, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our ſelues wilfull wantons, for whome there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo fit, as is the rod, and correction, and puniſhment? But if we wil néeds boaſt that we are the adopted children of God, let our boaſting and reioycing be ſéene in this, as to reioice of our infirmities, and to reioice that by Gods grace we are rid from many foule faultes, whereunto in former times we were inclined, and before we were the adopted children of God, and that by the force, and effect, and power, of Gods good ſpirit, ſuch matters are ouercome in vs. If we will reioyce of our adoption, let vs reioyce that through the meanes of our redéemer, we are deliuered and freed from Gods diſpleaſure, from damnation, and from the diuel, from hell, and from hell torments. According to that we reade, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 14. 15. Foraſmuch then as the children were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part with them, that he might deſtroy through death, him that

had the power of death, that is, the diuell. And that hee might deliuer all them, which for feare of death, were all their life time ſubiect to bondage. But now by Gods grace, hauing receiued ſo great a priuiledge, as to be his adopted children, although it be good for vs to feare, yet our feare is not ſuch, as may procéed from the ſpirit of bondage. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let vs be diſmaid, ſéeing that our conſciences are quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and we throughly perſwaded of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, but rather let vs reioyce, with the excéeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the holie Ghoſt, which powreth foorth ſwéet ioyes into the hearts of Gods children, and filleth them with ioy; let vs I ſay reioyce, that we may with boldneſſe approach to the throne of grace, and with méekeneſſe and chéerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, call God our louing and mercifull father. For we haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage to feare againe, but we haue receiued the ſpirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, <hi>Abba,</hi> that is to ſay, Father.</p>

That adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is vſed among vs, is in reſpect of alliance and kindred, as hauing no children of our owne, we take their children to be ours, which are next of kindred, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times if we fancie any of our friends children, or perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ſtraungers; we endowe them with goods and landes, and call them by our names. Againe, for ſome conſideration which we ſée to be in them, whom we adopt and make our childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereby we think them in ſome ſort, worthie of fauour; as beautie &amp; comely perſonage, wiſdom, courage, and manlineſſe, eloquence, ſobrietie, decent &amp; ciuil behauior, and ſuch like; which matters are admired &amp; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtéemed among men, which win their harts, and make them ſhew fauor. But in this our heauenly adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is no ſuch matter, it is not fleſh &amp; blood which God reſpecteth,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:7821:223"/>
no although they procéed from the loines and linage of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his poſteritie, vnto whom the promiſes were made, but they onely that are of the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For as the circumciſition of the heart is eſtéemed of God, then that which is outward, ſo are they the ſonnes and children of God, not which appeare to the world, (for the world knoweth them not) but who by the mercie and fauour of God, are drawen from the filth of the world, and are puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and clenſed by the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt. Which are borne not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the wil of man but of God: who by the preaching of his word, are begotten vnto him, and who by a liuely faith haue receiued him, to ſuch hath God giuen power to be his adopted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, euen to them which beléeue in his name. Among vs lightly we make our kindred, or friendes, or peraduenture ſtrangers our adopted children, but who is it that will make that choice of his enemies? But ſuch is the pitie and compaſſion of our mercifull God, who maketh vs his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who by nature would be none of his children, and who are giuen rather to hate, then to loue God. What is it therefore that God can ſée in vs, wherefore he ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt vs? ſurely nothing, but that which may make a ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but that God is ſo carefull of vs, that he ſendeth vs his word, euen the word of reconciliation, that we might be partakers of his adoption. It is not our good works, which are too light in the ballance, it is not any deſert of ours, whereby we ſhould be receiued into fauour? Inough there is in vs, and rather too much, to make vs to be refuſed and hated, but that which ſhould procure Gods fauour toward vs, there is nothing but that which is his, and none of ours.

ſparkes vnder a great heape of aſhes; and which as yet is more the continuall accuſations of the diuell, mouing our conſciences to diſpaire. The ſtrength of ſinne was ſo great, in that elect veſſell of God S. <hi>Paule,</hi> (who had ſuch an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent token of Gods adoption, that he was wrapt into the heauens and ſawe thoſe thinges which were not to be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, ſo that the loue of God was confirmed toward him in miraculous ſort) the ſtrength of ſinne was ſo great in him, that he was in a manner violently drawne to do that which he hated. <hi>What I would</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that doo I not, but that which I hate, that doo I. And I finde ſuch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in my ſinfull fleſh, rebelling againſt the lawe of my minde, which preuaile ſo farre with me, that they leade me captiue vnto the law of ſinne.

Wherefore although the accuſations of of the diuell, be of great force to throw vs downe, yet are the helpes which it pleaſeth God to graunt vs, more auail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to raiſe vs vp againe.

God to begin in this world, by ſowing in their harts the immortall ſéed of life, whereby he doth ſo certainly ſeale vnto them the grace of his adoption, that it ſhall continue firme vnto the end. In the meane time the faithfull are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, carefullie and humblie to examine themſelues, leaſt in ſtéede of a true faith, concerning their adoption, a carnall kinde of ſecuritie créepe into their minds and growe vpon them, and compaſſe them about, euen as the Iuie doth the Oake. The wicked haue neuer the féeling of gods grace, but after a confuſed ſort, taking hold as it were, rather of a ſhadow, then of a bodie. Becauſe the ſpirit of God, doth truly and properly ſeale the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſinnes, onelie in the hearts of the godlie and the elect, that they may apply the ſame, by an eſpeciall gift of faith, vnto their comfort. Confuſedly I ſay, the vngodlie receiue the grace of God, not that they are partakers togither with the children of God of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but becauſe they ſéeme to haue a ground of faith after a common ſort, which is hid with a vaile and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of hipocriſie. Yet notwithſtanding it may not be denied, that God doth lighten their mindes, ſo farre as they may ackowledge his grace and goodneſſe toward them, but this common ſence and féeling of his grace, is ſo diſtinguiſhed from that comfortable aſſurance of gods ſpirit, which is in the elect, that the wicked come ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to that ſounde comfort and ioy, which adoption brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it. For God dooth not ſo farre ſhewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe fauourable vnto them, as to take them into his guarde and kéeping, as though they were quite deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the puniſhment of their ſinnes, and from the feare of eternall death and damnation, but only for the preſent time, God doth giue them a taſte of his mercie. Neither is it amiſſe, that God doth lighten the mindes of the wicked, with ſome féeling of his gracious fauour, the which anon withereth and vaniſheth away, through the hardneſſe of their hearts, through their vnſtedfaſt mindes,

and through their owne vnthankfulneſſe and backſliding, wherby they make themſelues more culpable, and the more inexcuſable, all which is wonderfully brought to paſſe, by the manifold wiſedome of God.</p>
                     <p>That ſpirit of ours, which the Apoſtle talketh off, is a renued heart and a ſanctified minde, that fully and perfectly receiueth the benefit of adoption, and vnto which ſpirit of ours, gods ſpirite doth alſo beare witneſſe, that out of all doubt, we are the adopted children of god. The vngodly, they haue but as it were a glimſe, but vnto the godly, this great benefit and high dignity is fully reuealed in ſuch ſort, that they doo teſtifie euen to the ende of their liues, that they looke for and earneſtly deſire the full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereof. Whereas the courſe of a good life, is ſoone altered in the vngodlie, who with the Dogge returne to his vomite, and with the Sowe that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire.

The ſecond is, that they which haue an eſpeciall teſtimonie and witneſſe from the ſpirit of god, of their adoption, haue alſo in their hearts, the ſame affections to god, which children haue to their fathers, and which the godly doo owe one to an other.

Now this hartie, feruent, and loude crying in the eares of God, can the diuell giue to no hipocrite, neither to any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſon. For it is the ſpeciall marke of the ſpirite of God. Yea it is the thing that the diuel hateth moſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we reſiſt the diuel, and whereby alſo he is driuen backe from vs, which is a part of that ſpirituall armour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are defended from him. In all places, where by the counſell of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, we are admoniſhed to take héede, theſe are their words; <hi>Watch and pray, leſt ye enter into temptation; For the diuel goeth about like a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lion, ſeeking whome hee may deuoure.</hi> This is ſuch a waightie matter, to ouerthrowe the workes of the diuell, that he hath eſpeciall care, by all meanes to kéepe his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the vngodly from it. Marke the vngodly at any time, and ſée whether they haue any minde and zeale to pray, or if they do it at any time, it is rather for faſhion ſake, or any other conſideration, then willingly, rather vpon an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary neceſſitie, and extremitie, then vpon any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dutie, or dutifull affection. Which is to ſmall effect; for not euery one that can ſay, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heauen. Marke if they bee not giuen to anie thing elſe, then to ſubmit themſelues to ſo godly an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. Diuers hinderances can the diuell laie before vs, to withdrawe vs from praier. And in the vngodly, eſpecially the guiltineſſe of their conſciences, doth make them afraid to remember God. Or if at any time they can finde in their hearts to pray, the remembrance of Gods iudgements, and puniſhments for their hainous and vſuall offences, hanging ouer their heades, doth make them to thinke of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence no otherwiſe, then as of the preſence of a fearefull iudge. How then can they call him father, whoſe conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cannot as yet be throughly certified of the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes. Yea ſo farre off is it, that the wicked and vngodly ſhould be giuen to praier, that euen the godly, are oftentimes backward therein. And therefore the ſpirits of God, which beareth witneſſe to the hearts and conſciences
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:7821:227"/>
of the godly, that they are the children of God, I ſay, the ſame ſpirit helpeth our infirmities, and remoueth our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, and by good motions doth ſtirre vs vp and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vs thereunto, directing alſo our requeſts, according to the will of God. Yea although we know not how to pray, or what to pray as we ought, or with what earneſtneſſe of minde, (for all theſe matters are ſtraunge to fleſh and blood) yet the ſpirit of God, it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs, and that with ſuch ſighs and grones which cannot be expreſſed. We ſée therefore, how that praier is a true marke of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our adoption, and ſo much the more, by that we ſhall féele our ſelues often giuen thereunto, and often to vſe it, in all reuerence, and humilitie, and earneſtneſſe, eſpecially when we feele the motions of Gods good ſpirit to moue vs therunto. As alſo the wicked and vngodly may know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be farre from adoption, becauſe they neither féele any ſuch motions, being ouercome of the diuels temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and are alſo moſt backward &amp; moſt vnwilling to bowe their knées, and to humble their hearts.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond eſpeciall note or marke, wherby they that are the adopted children of God, are diſcerned and knowne from them which are not adopted, is that in the harts of the adopted, there are ſuch affections to godward, which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<note place="margin">Godly and Chriſtian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note> ought to beare to their fathers. Namely, loue, feare, reuerence, obedience, thankfulneſſe. For they call not vpon god as vpon a terrible iudge, but as vpon a mercifull and louing father. And theſe affections they haue not, whom ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanilludeth, and abuſeth with a phantaſticall imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſaluation. For it may be, that through hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or through cuſtome, they may call god father, but in truth and from the heart, they cannot do ſo: deceiuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, thinking that they belong to god, when as another day they ſhall finde cleane contrary. For the triall of theſe things, I meane whether we loue and feare god aright as we ought to doo, and as it becommeth the adopted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of god, is perceiued in a godly and Chriſtian life.

A ſeruant lightly is neuer preferred to that dignitie, as to be made an heire, and how ſhould it come to paſſe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wee being ſeruants and bondſlaues, vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of bondage &amp; feare, ſhould obtaine ſo great a fréedome and dignitie, as to be the heires of God, but only through the bountifulneſſe of God, which paſſeth all the preheminence and dignitie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> man can gine, or is, or would be willing to giue, eſpecially to a ſeruant.

It is not a thing vſuall in the world, that the ſonnes of any one man ſhould all be heires, no although their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors were nobles. Our prouerbe is, that a man of ſmal wealth, is called bnt ayonger brother, be it that he be a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and of a good houſe, yet he may be farre, both from the title and from the poſſeſſion of an heire. Which makes yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brothers oftentimes to come to hard &amp; miſerable ends, while they ſéeke euill waies to maintaine their gentry and theire ſtate, &amp; to hold vp their port and countenance, which by their pride commeth to a fall, and which by humilitie, would haue bin both increaſed and exalted.

thinke full baſely of themſelues. God oftentimes taketh the poore out of the mire, and placeth him among the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And the poore and ſorrowfull ſpirite, the repentant and ſanctified minde, is royally furniſhed, euen as <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi> was cloathed in royall apparell, becauſe hee had the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the king, and had the crowne royall ſet on his head, who looked to haue his head ſmitten from his ſhoulders. The whip and ſtripes belong to a ſeruaunt, and yoonger graceleſſe brethren come neuer to inheritance. So we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeruantes to ſinne, and graceleſſe in the ſight of God, ſhould neuer haue come to the royaltie of heires, if god by his mercy had not graunted vs repentance vnto life, and ſowed the ſéede of his grace in our heartes, eſtabliſhing our weake ſpirites with a ſound faith, and confirming the ſame with the certaintie of this hope, that we ſhall be heires. Heires not one or two, but euen all heires, as many as are his ſonnes and children, heires of that inheritance, which cannot be taken from vs, vnleſſe through our owne fault and negligence, we fall away from it, before we come to the full poſſeſſion thereof. Father I haue ſinned againſt heauen and before thée, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſonne. The father accepting his repentance, cauſed the beſt robe to be brought forth, and put vpon him, a ring to be put on his finger, and ſhooes on his féete, and killed the<note place="margin">Yoongeſt.</note> fatted calfe, and reioyced and was merry. What could he haue done more for his ſonne, euen the eldeſt ſonne, the heire? making the yoongeſt ſonne an heire too, as well as his eldeſt brother. Indéede the eldeſt in euery common weale, doth carry away inheritance: neither is the yoonger pertaker with him. But as the Prophet ſaith, God ſeeth not as man, neither is his iudgement as mans is. The firſt borne in earth hath the honour and the wealth, but in Gods account it falleth not out ſo alwaies.

Yea there ſhall come many from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, and from the North, and from the South, and ſhall ſit at table in the kingdom of heauen. And behold there are laſt, which ſhalbe firſt, and there are firſt which ſhalbe laſt. None think you but the children of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> to be heires? whoſe mother made requeſt for them vnto Chriſt, that her ſonnes might ſit, the one at his right hand, and the other at his left hand, in the kingdome. Nay ſaith Chriſt, that may not be granted, but it ſhalbe ginen to them, for whome it is prepared of my father. He is not a true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite which is one outward, neither is that circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh; but he is the true Iſraelite, which is one within, and the circumciſion is of the heart, in the ſpirit, not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God. So not all are heires, which ſéeme to be heires, but happy are they whoſoeuer, that haue the ſeale of Gods ſpirit within them, and warranting their harts, that they are heires, heires by promiſe, and heires of al Gods precious promiſes. The worldlings which carry a faire ſhewe, may be far from this inheritance, becauſe what through pleaſures, and what through cares of worldlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, they are hindred from ſéeking after this inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

God calleth by his word and by his grace, from day to day, from time to time, ſuch as are deſpiſed in the world, and ſuch as are reckoned to be the offſcouring of all, ſuch as make leaſt account of themſelues, euen ſuch and ſo manie, as ſhalbe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſo many as ſhalbe heires.

This is Gods doing, and it is maruellous in our ſight. Hearken my beloued brethren, ſaith the Apoſtle S. <hi>Iames. cap. 2. 5. <hi>Hath not God choſen the poore of the world, that they ſhould be rich in faith, and heires of the kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that loue him?</hi>
                        </hi> Let not the pooreſt be diſmaied, who though they haue no inheritance in this world, yet if they be rich in god, rich in faith, rich in all holy obedience to Gods will, if here they haue none inheritance, no not ſo much as the breadth of a foote, yet ſhall their lot and portion fall out in a large roome in the kingdome of heauen, ſo that they may ſay with ioy, that they haue a large inheritance. Their ragges and poore eſtatehere, ſhalbe requited with roial robes elſwhere, and they ſhalbe heires in heauen, which ſhall farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the eſtate and dignitie of a king here on earth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be as glorious and gliſtering, as euer was that of <hi>Salomon.</hi> Whoſe eſtate ſéemeth to be expreſſed by the words of the Prophet: <hi>Although ye haue lien among the pots, yet ſhall ye be as the winges of a doue, that is couered with ſiluer winges, and her fethers like gold.</hi> Againe, they that thinke themſelues the heires of God, and the eldeſt in holineſſe of life, ſhall come farre ſhort; ſuch as hypocrites are, and whoſe holineſſe is but counterfeite; and publicanes, and harlots ſhall go before them into the kingdome of God, becauſe repentance is ſéene in the one ſort, the other

thinke that they néede no repentance, yea they thinke that heauen is their due, and that they haue deſerued it, and thinke that they ſhall haue greate wronge, if they be put beſide it. Are the eldeſt therefore alwaies heires? or do not the youngeſt ſometimes take place? Doubtleſſe the yongeſt are often heires, and the laſt are accepted as firſt; I meane ſinners are made heires, ſuch in whome is repentance and faith, for whome it might be thought, that there is no roome, nor any place kept and reſerued for them in heauen.</p>
                     <p>But howe falleth it out, that ſéeing God hath an heire of his glorious inheritaunce, Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, of whome he pronounceth; This is my welbeloued ſonne, in whom I am well pleaſed; how falleth it out that their ſhould be more heires, and that we ſhould be heires. Surely as God amongſt all creatures, made moſt account of mankind, and ſéeing that al were loſt by iuſt deſert, yet in mercy it pleaſed him to make ſome his children, and for the further ſetting foorth of his glory, to make them alſo heires. In the nature of man he had no children, becauſe all were gone aſtray, all had corrupted their waies, and were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Yet as his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was and is moſt infinit, ſo the way to his mercy was euident to him, although hid from the world, and impoſſible to fleſh &amp; blood, which ſat in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death. For God ſo loued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, that he hath giuen his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten ſonne, that whoſoeuer beléeueth in him ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life. And God ſent not his ſonne into the world, that he ſhould condemne the world, but that the world through him might be ſaued. So it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out with vs, after the cuſtome of men, that yoonger brethren come not to inheritance, without the death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of the elder.

Wherefore hée is not aſhamed ſaieth the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 11. to call them brethren. How great is our dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, in that we haue Chriſt to be our brother, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſuffered his paſſion, and roſe the third day, ſaid vnto the women, vnto whome hee appeared, and vnto whome it pleaſed him to ſhewe himſelfe. <hi>Goe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and tell my brethren.</hi> Altogither contrary to the courſe of the world, for the rich are ſo farre from calling the poore their brethren, that they diſdaine them; and ſo farre from giuing them inheritance with their children, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vouchſafe they ſhould kéepe them company. Well, with God there is no reſpect of perſons, and the poore are as dear

to him as the rich, nay oftentimes he hath greater care for them, and prouideth for them a greater and larger inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if not in this world, yet in another. A wealthie man that hath great landes and poſſeſſions, if he haue but one ſonne, is neuer awhit diſpleaſed, neither doth he ſéeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more, to adopt them, and to make them partners with his ſonne. But rather reioyceth in his mind, that his ſonne ſhall not in time to come, be conſtrained to diuide the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce with his brethren. Whereby the loue of god aboundeth towardes vs, who hauing one beloued ſonne, would yet haue more to beare him company, and more on whome he might beſtowe this royaltie, as to make them heires with his ſonne.

Howe then ſhall hée not therewith giue vs all thinges alſo? Hée that hath made vs Lordes ouer all his creatures here on earth, ſhould we doubt that he will not vouchſafe vs an heauenly dignitie? The Angels are they not all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring ſpirites, ſent foorth to miniſter for their ſakes, which ſhall be heires of ſaluation? <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 14.

                        </gap>rethren, nay crowned Kings, becauſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen ſhall bee our inheritaunce. According as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. Epiſtle 2. 9. informeth vs; <hi>Yee are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a choſen generation, a royall prieſthood, an holie nation, a peculiar people, graced foorth with a ſingular excellencie and preheminence, in that wee are ſaid to bee the thrones of God, and that wee ſhall fit vppon throanes.</hi> What comfort then is it for vs all, that of the ſonnes of darkneſſe, we are made the ſonnes
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:7821:234"/>
of light; of the enemies of God, reconciled friends; of the ſeruants and children of the diuell, of Gods wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogither fearfull and doubtfull, of the children of this world, and of euerlaſting perdition; that wee are made the ſeruants of God, fully partakers of his grace; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſtaied and confirmed therein, citizens of heauen; and heires of euerlaſting conſolation.</p>
                     <p>Which ſerueth mightily, and ſtandeth vs greatly in ſtéede, to raiſe vp our weake mindes and faint heartes, which are caſt downe through the remembraunce of our gréeuous ſinnes, and which ſhall kéepe vs from falling into diſpaire; that when Sathan, togither with our owne guiltie conſciences, ſhall perſwade vs, that wée are none of Gods children, euen then, that the ſpirite of God ſhall certifie our hearts, that we be heires of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</p>
                     <p>This that we are heires, hath two profitable leſſons, to lift vp our mindes, and alſo to humble vs, leſt we be too much exalted. For this inheritance commeth not vnto vs by deſert, but through grace and mercy, that we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giue God the praiſe and thankes, then boaſt in our ſelues, who haue nothing, but that which is giuen &amp; gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nothing but that whereof we be vouchſafed. To hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs, being put in minde of our dutie, as the Apoſtle warneth vs. 1. <hi>Peter. 1. 17. <hi>And if wee call him father, which without reſpect of perſons, iudgeth according to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans worke, let vs paſſe the time of our dwelling heere in feare.</hi>
                        </hi> And ſéeing God hath made vs his ſonnes by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo much the more are we bound, to feare and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe he hath adopted vs of his only fauour, when he might worthily haue caſt vs off, and put vs by for our vnthankfulneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Vnto theſe two profitable leſſons, we may adde two ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular comfortes; the one concerning our afflictions and troubles, and diſtreſſes, in this tranſitorie life: the other, concerning our blottes and blemiſhes, our ſinnes and
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:7821:235"/>
offences. And therefore verie fitly and very well, ſaith a godly writer in this reſpect. All thinges, yea gréeuous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and ſin it ſelfe, turne to their good and bettering, who are choſen to be heires. Afflictions, ſinne, death, are very profitable vnto them, howe hurtfull ſoeuer they be in their owne nature. Death which ſéemeth to be the worſt of all, yea moſt terrible, is not an entrance into hell, as it is to the worſt ſort and to the vngodly, but to them it is a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row gate to let them in, into euerlaſting life, and therfore moſt ioyfully and moſt chéerefully they vndertooke it, being glad that the time of their diſſolution doth approach, and that their miſeries ſhall haue an end, and that the courſe of ſinne ſhalbe cut off.</p>
                     <p>As for afflictions, vnleſſe they did tend to the good of the godly, and the adopted children of God, God would not lay them vpon them, and put them to ſuch hazardes and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Yea the godly are ſo affected, that with <hi>Iob</hi> they can ſay; <hi>If God doe kill me, yet will I put my truſt in him:</hi> And becauſe his loue is ſhead abroad in our hearts, therefore ſhall no diſcomfort vtterly diſmay vs. Wherein alſo this comforteth our heartes, that God wil lay no more vpon vs, then that he will make vs able to beare; and further that he will giue a ioyfull iſſue to all our troubles and vexations, and temptations. For in that he ſuffered and was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he is able to ſuccour and to helpe them that ſuffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and are tempted. So that we may looke for comfort at Gods hand, euen ſuch as ſhalbe grounded vpon the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and infallible promiſes of God, and ſuch as ſhalbe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the meaſure of our afflictions, troubles, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and temptations. If we be children, we are alſo heires, euen the heires of God, and heires annexed with Chriſt, if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified with him: For I count ſaith the Apoſtle, that the afflictions of this preſent time, and of this preſent tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie life, are not worthy y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> glorie which ſhalbe reuealed and ſhewed vnto vs, &amp; whereof in due time we ſhalbe partakers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="451" facs="tcp:7821:235"/>Now as for our ſinnes, it is ſo farre off, that they ſhall<note place="margin">The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſins, no hurt to the adopted, to diſmay them, and to put them beſide their hope.</note> bréed any trouble, vnquietneſſe or vexation of minde, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue vs from the hope of our inheritance, that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof, ſhalbe as a goade or a ſpurre, to haſten vs on to perſorme all good workes. And as we haue giuen our members as weapons of vnrighteouſneſſe to ſinne, ſo ſhall we with all readineſſe giue our ſelues vnto God, as they that are aliue from the dead, and as they who by the power of Chriſt their ſauior, haue fully triumphed ouer the world and the fleſh, and the deuill, ouer ſinne, and death, and hell. For behold this thing, that we haue béen great offenders, what care it will worke in vs, leaſt we ſhould fall into ſin againe; what holy anger and indignation againſt our ſelues, for our ſinnes paſt; what a deſire to pleaſe God; what a zeale and forwardneſſe in all goodneſſe; and greatly indeuouring alſo the contrary to thoſe ſinnes, wherein we haue greatly offended. If in drunkenneſſe, auoiding all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and vſing all ſobrietie; if in filthineſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſſe, in whoredome and wantonneſſe, hating the ſin, auoiding the meanes of our fall, and framing our ſelues to all holineſſe and chriſtian conuerſation: and ſo likewiſe in all other ſinnes. After king <hi>Dauid</hi> had committed adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and murder, how did he repent him? how zealous was he in all goodneſſe? after that God had giuen him a newe heart: inſomuch that the ſcripture teſtifieth of him, that he was a man after Gods owne heart. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the remembrance of his earneſt and cruell perſecution, made him moſt earneſt in his office and profeſſion. I thank God, ſaith he, which hath made me valiant to fight vnder his banner, and ſtrong to indure all trouble and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when as before, I was a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and an oppreſſor. And againe. 1. <hi>Cor. 19. 9. 10. <hi>I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, which am not meete to be called an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the church of God. But yet by the grace of God, I am, that I am, and his grace which is in me was not in vaine, for I laboured more aboundantly then</hi>
                        </hi>
                        <pb n="452" facs="tcp:7821:236"/>
they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which is with me. The remembrance of our ſinnes is no hinderance to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but it maketh vs the more forward. If I haue done any wrong to any man ſaith <hi>Zacheus,</hi> I reſtore him foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. This effect alſo had the remembrance of ſinne in that ſinnefull woman <hi>Marie Magdalene,</hi> out of whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt caſt ſeuen diuels, euen ſhe that was notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for her lewde and light behauiour. Who as by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſhe died vnto ſinne, ſo the memory of her ſinne is dead and buried vnto her, in this reſpect, becauſe ſhe liueth ſtill in the glorious remembrance of that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which penitent ſinners obtaine by faith. She is hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably mentioned, whereſoeuer the goſpell of Chriſt is read and heard of, all men ſpeake of her teares, of her ſins no one is mentioned and knowne. But touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remembrance of her former ſinnes, ſée what it wrought. The precious oile wherewith ſhe was wont to annoint her ſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſhe might be more pleaſant to the ſences of her louers, ſhe nowe pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out, and for loues ſake, beſtoweth it vppon her Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. The eies which were wont to caſt wanton lookes vpon the diſſolute, did now guſh out with water, &amp; ſerued as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> féete of Chriſt. The haire which before had béene wrapt in gold, had bene coloured, pleated, &amp; broidered, laid out and beſet with pearles, was now imploied to a farre other vſe, that the honour receiued from the féete of Ieſus, might put out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhame which before it had taken, from the eies of leaud &amp; amorous beholders. Hauing waſhed and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe could not ſatiſfie her ſelfe, till ſhe had alſo kiſſed her ſauiours féete, whoſe mercy now had eaſed her heart of that deadly ſting, which the lippes of wantons had imprinted and left behinde them. The remembrance of ſinnes paſt is gréeuous, that vertue practiſed in ſtéede thereof, may be more comfortable. The one burthenſome, the other ioyfull. Yea what is it that ſhould procure our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſéeing we are vouchſafed ſo great a priuiledge, as to be accounted of God to be his children. What ioy ſhould it
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:7821:236"/>
be vnto vs, that wee are lifted vp vnto this high dignitie, as to be the ſaints of God, temples of the holy ghoſt, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, Lordes ouer all (the Angels of God to bee our friendes, our helpers and aiders, the watchmen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God to watch ouer vs, that no hurt ſhould come vnto vs, otherwiſe then it pleaſeth our good and gracious God, who as we may fully perſwade our ſelues, doth all for our good, and all for the beſt) citizens of heauen, thrones of God, heires of God, brethren and ſiſters of Chriſt, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heires with him in the kingdome of heauen. Finally, whether it be the world, or life, or death, whether it be Angels, principalities, or powers, whether they be things preſent, or things to come, euen all ours, and we Chriſts, and Chriſt Gods. And yet beholde, this is not the one halfe of that dignitie, the one halfe of that excellent glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, whereunto hereafter we ſhall attaine, being heires with Chriſt, and members of his bodie. For where the head is, there ſhall the members be. And as we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the fulneſſe of his grace, ſo ſhall wée alſo be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the fulneſſe of his glorie. Hauing giuen vs an aſſuraunce thereof alreadie, becauſe hée is gone to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare vs euerlaſting dwelling places, in ſuch ſort, that in time to come, when all things are prepared for vs, he will come againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 3. to receiue vs vnto himſelfe, and to entertaine vs moſt friendly, moſt bountifully, moſt honourably, moſt roially. <hi>Dearely beloued</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. Epiſtle 3. 2. <hi>now are wee the ſonnes of God, but yet it doth not appeare what we ſhall be.</hi> And we knowe that when hée ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him, being glorious members of a glorious head. The certaintie of our adoption, and this dignitie, that wee are heires in hope, and ſhall be hereafter in ſure poſſeſſion, is a ſteppe to our glorification. The full fruition and enioying wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wée ſhall not receiue, till this life bee ended. For by death wee muſt bee tranſlated, to the poſſeſſion of ſo great and waighty matters, and of ſuch a wonderfull glory.
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:7821:237"/>
Our life is hid with Chriſt, and vntill we come to Chriſt, (as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to haue his bodie diſſolued and to be with Chriſt) our life and our glorie ſhall not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:7821:239"/>
to death it ſelfe; doth therfore forewarne them, that for no trouble, no not for death it ſelfe, that they ſhrinke from him. Becauſe it was their lot, and they were not to looke for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entertainment of the world, then he him ſelfe had. Wherefore they mnſt ether ioine with the world, or cleaue vnto him; loue the one, and forſake the other. And if they did looke to liue in ioy with him, they ſhould indure ſome ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, yea heapes of ſorrow. For nothing that is excellent, is gotten with eaſe. The worlde ſhall procure ye ſorrow i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the world ſhall haſten your death, which is but your triall; yea they ſhall do theſe things toward you, with ſuch an earneſtneſſe, and ſuch a blinde zeale, that although they moſt wrongfully and moſt ſpitefully, and that moſt cruelly kill ye, yet will they thinke they doo God ſeruice. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell therfore that theſe dumps of Chriſt his departure, and of the worlds troubleſome and cruell behauiour, did bring them ſorrow inough. As Chriſt confeſſeth himſelfe; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue ſaid and ſhewed you theſe things, your harts are full of ſorrow.</hi> In theſe wordes which I haue read vnto vnto you, thrée principall matters may be noted worthie of your conſideration. The firſt is, the burthen impoſed and laide vpon the diſciples, as alſo vpon all the godly. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, that ye ſhall weepe and lament.</hi> In the ſecond part, is noted out the ioy of the wicked, wherein by reaſon of the words following, may alſo be comprehended a difference betwixt the godly and the wicked, concerning ioy and ſorrow. <hi>The word ſhall reioyce, and ye ſhall ſorrow.</hi> The third principall matter, ſetteth downe a remedie full of all comfort to the godly, that their ſorrowes, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and croſſes, ſhall be requited and recompenced with ioy, and ſuch ioy, that ſhall not be taken from them.</p>
                     <p>When any ſorrowfull matter was toward a people, or a nation, and it pleaſed God to let them vnderſtand thereof by his Prophets, their heauy meſſage, they terme it a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.<note place="margin">Burthen.</note> No doubt a burthen too heauie to beare, but yet ſuch as could not be auoyded. And ſuch in this place is the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

which our Sauiour Chriſt laieth vpon his diſciples and all the godly, ſo certaine and ſo ſure, that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe confirmeth it with an oath. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, that ye ſhall weepe and lament.</hi> Which is inough to caſt a wordling beſide the practiſe of all godlineſſe, ſeeing that ſorrow and griefe is ioyned therewith. The yong man ſpoken of in the Goſpell would follow Chriſt, but when he muſt part with his goods, he departed from Chriſt, being ſadde and heauie. When godlineſſe hath the countenance of the world, euerie one will be godly, but when the hatred of the world is ioyned therewith, that makes many make a pauſe. We cannot ſerue God and riches, ſo neither can wée ſerue God and the world, they be two maiſters. Euery one deſireth ioy, but ioy with wéeping and lamentation they will none. The ſonnes of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> looke for heauen and the higheſt roomes, but it was firſt told them that they muſt taſte of a bitter cup, and take vp the croſſe. Our haſtie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires cannot bee ſatiſfied, neither can we preſently flie into heauen, a heauie burthen muſt firſt be borne, much ſorrow muſt firſt be endured. No man willingly deſireth a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, it muſt not therefore be ſought after, but borne, when wée cannot auoid it. Chriſt ſweat bloud before he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp into heauen, neither is it inough to ſhead teares, but we muſt goe through many matters that cauſe teares, before that we ſhalbe receiued where we would wiſh to be.</p>
                     <p>Being thus framed to perfection, as much as in this life may be, and reſtored to the image of God, in ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as it ſhall pleaſe God to inable vs, God hath ſo appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that we ſhalbe tried by many ſorrowes, by many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, before that our happy deſire ſhalbe accompliſhed.

Whereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though héeretofore I haue diſcourſed, yet will it not bee much amiſſe in this place alſo to make remembrance of them. <hi>Man that is borne of a woman</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iobe) is of ſhort continuance, and full of trouble.</hi> Hée ſaid ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hée founde it to bee true.

God laying this condition vppon vs, dooth it to this purpoſe, euen to trie our obedience, as alſo to make our patience perfect, or to make vs perfect through patience. Looke how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wantes, ſo many ſorrowes; howe many loſſes, ſo many ſorrowes; howe many chaunges, and howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie troubles, ſo manie ſorrowes. And manie are the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:7821:240"/>
troubles of the righteous, but the Lord in time giueth eaſe to them all. Our Sauiour Chriſt was neuer ſeene to laugh, but to wéepe, ſignifying that the life of them that ſhould bee made like vnto his image, ſhould bee rather wéeping and lamentation, then reioycing. <hi>It is good</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt) <hi>to bee heere, let vs therefore builde three tabernaces, one for thee, another for <hi>Moſes,</hi> another for <hi>Elias,</hi>
                        </hi> but he forgot himſelfe and knewe not what hée ſaid. For that ioyfull preſence was but for a moment, and they were but foreſhewers of troubles and ſorrowes to come. God commaunded the Iſráelites to dwell in Tentes, to put them in minde ſtill of remoouing, as though there were no ioy in this life, but ſtill it would haue his chaunge. The Iſraelites were the people whome God appointed to bee heires of his heauenly kingdome, but by their earthly peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the lande of <hi>Canaan,</hi> God ſhewed them, and vs by them, howe full of ſorrowes this life is, before we ſhall come to heauen. For God brought not the Iſraelites ſtraightway into the land of promiſe, that goodly land flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with milke and honie, and abounding with all things, which hee had ſworne vnto their fathers that they ſhould poſſeſſe, but led them vp and downe, too and fro in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, by the ſpace of fortie yeares, enduring many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. By that meanes holding them in continuall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and teaching them to forſake the worlde, and only to depend vpon him from whoſe holy ſpirit commeth all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. It is a rare thing, that a ſhip paſſing on the ſea, ſhould ſtill haue faire weather and a quiet calme to her iournies end. Yea rather ſtormes and tempeſts, ſurges and waues, ſhelues and ſandes, rockes, and whirlepooles, and ſome of theſe it lightly méetes withall. And how can the life of man bee without ſorrow? Yea the wicked themſelues, who ſéeme to haue all the ioyes and pleaſures of this world, (according to Chriſtes words; <hi>The world ſhall reioyce)</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sorrow of the wicked.</note> they alſo ſometimes féele ſmart and ſorrow, and wéeping

alſo commeth to them, but full ſore againſt their willes. And where by this meanes God trieth the patience of the godly, ſo alſo in theſe ſorrowes of the wicked, their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and impatiencie doth vtter itſelfe, grudging and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, fretting and ſuming, curſing and ſwearing, being rather monſters out of ſhape, then men according to Gods making, bearing the image not of God, but of the diuell. The ſorrowes of the vnfaithfull and of the vngodly doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurt them, then prepare them vnto God. In as much as their impatiencie is increaſed, and they through their owne fault are brought to deſperation and damnation. But the ſorrowes of the godly are ſo farre from hindering their felicitie and happineſſe in heauen, as that vſually they be helpes and furtherances thereunto, and they make a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of them, which the other can neither ſée nor behold. According to that the patriarcke <hi>Iacob</hi> foreſaw, that his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie ſhould haue manie ſorrowes, troubles, croſſes and afflictions, but his faith and ſetled hope was, that the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious hand of god ſhould neuer be wanting. <hi>O Lord I haue waited for thy ſaluation.</hi>

The daies of this world to the godly, are nothing elſe in a manner, but diſmall daies, and ſorrowfull times, yea, the eſtate of all in this world is but ſorrowfull. Either we are hated of the world, or elſe which is worſe, of God; aſſaulted of Sathan, ſubiect to the manifold diſeaſes both of body and ſoule, the one miſerable, the other moſt daungerous and intollerable. Many in number, and diuers in nature, are the ſorrowes that fall out in the world. Some are afflicted by exile and baniſhment, ſome by captiuitie and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome by famine and nakedneſſe, ſome by perill &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, ſome by ſlander and reproachfull contumely, ſome by rackings &amp; tearing in péeces, ſome by ſlaughter &amp; ſword, ſome by fire and fagot, ſome by ſores of bodie, and ſundry diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſome ſuffer in themſelues, ſome are afflicted in their friends, in their wiues, in their children, ſom in their goods, ſome in their bodies, ſome in their credits, ſom by ſea, ſome by land, ſome at home, ome abroad, ſome by open enemies, ſome by counterfait friends, ſome by cruell oppreſſion, ſome by manifeſt iniuries, ſome by force, ſome by fraud, ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by one meanes, ſome by an other. So many kinds of ſorrowes there are. Man neuer continueth in one ſtate, to day in his princely throne, to morrow in his duſtie graue, to day placed in great authority, to morrow caſt out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, to day in high fauour, to morrow in high diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, now rich, now poore, now in wealth, now in woe, now ſound, now ſicke, now ioyfull, now full of ſorrow, to day a man, to morrow nothing. O how ſhort, how chaungeable, and how miſerable is the ſtate of mortall men! And happy are they, who can make this leſſon of the ſorrowes of this world, as by meditation thereof, to long after heauen. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe there is inough, becauſe no ioy in reſpect; and if the world affoord any ioy, it is not true, ſound, and certaine. For what ioy or pleaſure ſoeuer there is in the world, it is mingled with ſome ſorrow.

Here you ſée a ſorrow, marke alſo a ſecret, and a miſtery, and let euery one laie it to their heart. For the reaſon why the Lord doth ſo is, becauſe we ſhould not periſh. While we euioyed them, we forgot our ſelues, and God by this means doth put vs in minde, that we ſhould not forget him. God draweth vs away from theſe matters, leſt his iudgements ſhould ouertake vs as well as others. Yea he draweth vs forcibly, by want of theſe benefites. Let vs not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied, or hang downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head for ſorrow, knowing for what end God worketh theſe ſorrowes, all to our good, and all for the beſt. Ye ſhall wéepe and lament, and the world in theſe maſters ſhall reioyce, but their ioy ſhall be turned into ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. For all theſe worldly comforts ſhall periſh, and they
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:7821:244"/>
with them, becauſe they rather abuſed them, then vſed them as they ought. Your ſorrowes alſo in theſe matters ſhall haue ſome recompence when God ſeeth good, and if it be alſo for your good, and you ſhall be comforted with riches, honours, friends, pleaſures, wife, children, and euery néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing. Then ſhall ye finde it true which the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> aſſureth you, <hi>Pſal. 84. <hi>No good thing ſhall he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from them that leade a godly life.</hi>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> though ye wept not. Yet is the loſſe of good name and fame by ſlaunder and euill reports more bitter, then theſe loſſes, and more heauily taken; and the ſorrowe ſinketh déeper. Some are frée from it, but not all; and this is a knowne trueth, that the more that euerie one dooth excell in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodneſſe, the more they are hated, enuied, and ſlaundered. Becauſe ye followe not exceſſe and riot, ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> therefore the world hateth you. But this is a comfort as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith; 2. Epiſtle 4. 5. <hi>They ſhall giue account to him that is readie to iudge quicke and dead, the Iudge ſtandeth at the doore, and his iudgement is neare.</hi> The beſt of all, Chriſt our Sauiour, was worſt ſpoken off. They are not the beſt that bring vp ſlaunders, but the worſer ſort, whoſe good reports are but little woorth, as alſo their ſlaunders are not to be regarded. It is a thing worthie a Prince, (ſaith a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Monarch of the worlde, being ſlaundered and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſpoken off) when thou haſte done well, to heare ill. They that are famous and of renowme, haue pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh peſaunts to diſgrace them, whoſe tongues were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer exerciſed in ſaying well. This is a ſorrowe which muſt bee endured: and furthermore, thou muſt pray for them, and bleſſe them which bring this ſorrowe vpon thée, and ſo ouercome them, which by no other meanes<note place="margin">The perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſorrow of Perſecution, which is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially meant in this text.</note> can be wonne.</p>
                     <p>But aboue all ſorrowes on the earth, there ſéemeth none to be compared to the loſſe of life, for life is ſwéet. Yet this is the ſorrow which here is meant, and in this place
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:7821:244"/>
commanded, and which we muſt endure, if we looke to be the heires of heauen. As the Apoſtle witneſſeth writing to the Romanes, who putting them in minde of great priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, dooth alſo perſwade them to the patient enduring of all troubles and perſecutions. <hi>If yee be children, yee are heires, if heires, the heires of God, and fellowe heires with Chriſt, if ſo be ye ſuffer with him, that ye may alſo be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him.</hi> Ye ſhall wéepe and lament, becauſe that gréeuous perſecution is your lot, and the loſſe of life the thing that you muſt looke for. And how can it but make fraile fleſh to wéepe and lament, ſéeing that to liue is the greateſt ioy in the worlde, and nothing more againſt our nature, then to heare of perſecution and of death. And no meruaile though the Diſciples and the godly ſhead teares, when this matter cauſed our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, through anguiſh of minde to ſweate bloud, and<note place="margin">How back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; how readie wee ſhould be.</note> to deſire that this cuppe might paſſe from him. In the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter,</hi> we may perceiue the mind of a naturall man, loth to vndertake ſo great a matter, who when hee heard Chriſt our Sauiour to foretell of his perſecution and death, ſaying; that he muſt go to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſuffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of the Elders, and of the high Prieſts &amp; Scribes, and be ſlaine, then did he take him aſide, and beganne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him, ſaying; <hi>Maiſter pittie thy ſelfe, this thing ſhall not be vnto thee.</hi> But ſo farre off is it, that we ſhould be loth and tardie, that we ſhould be moſt forward and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.

The readineſſe of our Sauiour Chriſt, whoſe example, if it be too high for imitation, yet that of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paule</hi> heerein is notable; and able to giue the weakeſt minde great courage.

Who preaching vnto the people of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and bleſſednes, concludeth and ſhutteth vp the treatiſe of bleſſedneſſe, with the worthie eſtate of them that ſuffer perſecution for the truth. As though none were more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed then they, as though they aboue all other, ſhould haue the garland and weare the crowne. Bleſſed are they which ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. Bleſſed are ye when men reuile you, and perſecute you, and ſay all maner of euil againſt you for my ſake falfly. Reioice and be glad, for great is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heauen. For the extremeſt torments that we may be put to, and which we may vndertake in this life, are not worthy of that glorious crowne, which we ſhall receiue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conqueſt, and after our trial, and after our triumph. Therfore the Apoſtle doth wel terme all puniſhments, and all afflictions, &amp; all extremities, to be light, becauſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure but a moment, as alſo in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reward which is beyond all compariſon, ſéeing they ſhall procure vnto vs a far more excellent &amp; an eternal waight of glory. While we looke not on the things y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are ſéene, but on the things which are not ſéene. For the things which are ſéene are temporall, but the things which are not ſéen, are eternal. Mark but one preſident &amp; worthie matter, in the afflictions &amp; perſecutions of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul. <hi>Act.</hi>

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:7821:248"/>
and of a Chriſtian profeſſion. We are not the firſt that haue bene put to bitter perſecution, and if the valiant captaines haue ſtood to it, why ſhould the ſouldiers ſhrincke? Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples we haue many, the Prophets that were before Chriſt, Chriſt himſelfe, and the Apoſtles that followed Chriſt, as alſo a multitude of Martyrs, who through their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, haue yéelded themſelues to bitter death and extreame torments at all times, and in all ages, euen as a rare and new <hi>Phoenix</hi> doth ſpring out of the aſhes of the old. And therefore it is well ſaid; <hi>Sanguis martyrum, ſemen eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae.</hi> The blood of the Martyres, is the ſéede of the church, and one Martyr maketh many. What hope is ſo ſure and certaine, that well they may be ſlaine, and death they will not refuſe; yet is it impoſſible they ſhould bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. <hi>Abel</hi> was murthered of <hi>Cain,</hi> and the crie of his blood went vp to heauen for vengeance; <hi>Elias</hi> was perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted to death by that idolatrous <hi>Iezabel. Zachary</hi> the ſonne of righteous <hi>Iehoida,</hi> ſtoned to death by that reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting King <hi>Ioas; Amos</hi> ſmitten with a clubbe on the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the head, and ſo brained; <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſawed in two parts with a woodden ſawe; <hi>Ieremy</hi> perſecuted often, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned very ſore, throwne downe into the déepe, filthie, and miry dungeon, and at length ſtoned to death in <hi>Egypt</hi> of his owne people; <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſlain at <hi>Babilon</hi> by the Duke of the people; <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> beheaded. Of our Sauiour Chriſt, although I might intreat at large of his perſecution and intollerable death, becauſe in ſoule hée felt and ſuffered the torments of hell, yet becauſe the matter is ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, I thinke it néedleſſe. Only I will recite the words of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. Let vs looke vnto Ieſus the authour and finiſher of our faith, who for the ioy that was ſet before him, endured the croſſe, and deſpiced the ſhame, and is ſet at the right hand of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throne of God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore him that endured ſuch ſpeaking againſt of ſinners, leaſt yee ſhould bee wearied and fainte in your minds. And although ye haue not reſiſted vnto bloud, yet
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:7821:249"/>
your owne blood muſt be nothing in your ſight. Faint not, heauen and earth ſhall vaniſh away, but Gods promiſe ſhall haue no end, which is this; <hi>Great is your reward in heauen.</hi> Next to Chriſt, let vs beholde his Apoſtles, whether they dranke not of the ſame cup. <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified, and <hi>Paul</hi> beheaded at <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder <hi>Nero,</hi> that I ſpeake nothing of their whipping and ſcourging, bandes and impriſonment, which they ſuffered before their death. <hi>Battholomew</hi> was ſlaine aliue in <hi>India,</hi> and after his ſkinne was pulled ouer his eares, beheaded. <hi>Steuen</hi> was ſtoned; The diſcourſe of whoſe perſecution and death, is notably ſet downe, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. and worthie often to be read and to be remembred. As for the examples of Martyrs they are infinit, and that famous booke of the Acts and Monuments of the Church, ſhall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie thée in this point. Stories at large, and I thinke it te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious here to bring in many. If thou deſireſt but one ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and one example for all, looke vppon that famous and wonderfull example of the ſeuen brethren, mentioned 2. <hi>Macc.</hi> 7. who only is able to confirme the weakeſt heart. Which Chapter when I reade, and thinking to recite ſomewhat aboue the reſt more notable, I ſawe I could not do it, vnleſſe I ſet downe the whole Chapter, vnto the which I referre thée, as alſo to the ſixt Chapter of the ſame booke, concerning <hi>Eleazarus,</hi> And let vs all pray, that God would inable vs, with the like ſtrength, when time ſhall come that God laie this burthen vpon vs.</p>
                     <p>Theſe arguments, firſt of Gods commandement; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of the feareful puniſhment that ſhall enſue, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe or deny; Thirdly, the great and infinit bleſſings which come vnto vs if we doo performe that which is required at our hands; And fourthly, the examples of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and Martyres, to encourage vs, are of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient waight to perſwade to this worthie worke. Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,<note place="margin">Six o her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments briefly collected.</note> let me briefly and in a word, adde theſe reaſons.

<pb n="479" facs="tcp:7821:249"/>
are but for a moment, and nothing more ſure then death. Thirdly, that by enduring perſecution and death we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine gods glory, and confirme his truth, whereby we ſhall pleaſe God and die in his fauour. Fourthly, we ſhalbe witneſſes againſt the vnbeléeuing world, as alſo by our conſtancy and courage, we ſhall eſtabliſh the wauering mindes, which by our fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

According to that of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul Philip. 1. 12.</hi> I would you vnderſtood brethren, that the things which haue come vnto me, are turned rather to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Goſpell. So that my bands in Chriſt, are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous throughout all the iudgement hall, and in all other places; In ſo much, that many of the brethren in the Lord, are boldned through my bands, and dare more franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake the word. Yea the aduerſary king <hi>Agrippa</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was almoſt become a Chriſtian. Fiftly, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and courage ſhalbe a cauſe of greater condemnation to our enemies, whoſe conſciences are by this means made without excuſe. As the ſame Apoſtle in the chapter recited ſaith; In nothing feare your aduerſaries &amp; enemies, which is a token to them of perdition and deſtruction, and to you a token of ſaluation, and that of God. For vnto you it is giuen for Chriſt, that not only ye ſhould beléeue in him, but alſo ſuffer for his ſake. Sixtly and laſtly, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the kingdome of the diuel, which is only eſtabliſhed by lies and vntruth.</p>

All ſuch boaſting is in vaine. For that ye ought to ſay, if the Lord will, and if the Lord giue ſtrength, we will do ſo. Know ye not that your wils are wauering, and fleſh is fraile, and ſathan is ſubtile, and the world is tyrannous and cruell, and againe ye know not how all things wil fall out. Promiſe nothing before the time, but pray to God to make thée able. Sit down firſt and caſt thy accounts, bethinke thy ſelfe of the force of thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the diuels potentates, of thy weakeneſſe, which of it ſelf cannot ſtand, and many the like matters. This wil aſke a long time, to conſult and deliberate with thy ſelfe. Who ſeeth not that they that are moſt cowardly in the battel, are moſt valiant before they come to the field. Great boaſters may well be compared to barking dogs, which haue no cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to fight when they be ſet vpon. Our ſauior Chriſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to great wiſedom in this matter, for he knew what was in man, how that the boldeſt would be readie inough to draw backward. For after that he had exhorted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his croſſe, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enduring of perſecution, he put forth a parable to make euery one fully to bethinke themſelues, leſt they ſhould reuolt after they were reſolued. <hi>Luke. 14. <hi>Which of you</hi>

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:7821:250"/>
words, but ſwore alſo vnto him by an oath, that he would make him rich and wealthie, if he would forſake the lawes of his fathers, and that he would take him as a friend, and giue him offices. If there bee any ſhewe of faintneſſe to bee perceiued in thée, then come thundring, threatnings, like thunderbolts to caſt thée downe. Beſides, although thou be neuer ſo innocent and guiltleſſe and without fault, yet be ſure thou ſhalt haue falſe reports raiſed vp, miſchée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous accuſations, intollerable and diuelliſh ſlaunders de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed againſt thée, and laide to thy charge. Theſe are they which ſubuert the ſtate of the world, and heere they are; they obſerue not the kings lawes, therefore it is not the kings profit to ſuffer them. When the Iewes led Chriſt to <hi>Pilate,</hi> they did accuſe him (but falſly and vndeſeruedly) ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; We haue found this man peruerting the people, and forbidding to paie tribute to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> ſaying that he is Chriſt a king. The malicious Iewes laid hands on the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and mooued the people. Crying, Men of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> helpe: this is the man that teacheth all men euerie where againſt the people, and the lawe, and this place. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſaith <hi>Tertullus</hi> the Orator, (accuſing the Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Felix</hi> the Gouernour) we haue founde this man a peſtilent fellowe, and a moouer of ſedition among all the Iewes throughout the worlde. Looke to theſe matters, caſt thy count, prepare thy minde, leaſt after thou haſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with thy ſelfe to be conſtant, thou become waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Many feares to hold vs back, fleſh and blood loth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from worldly comforts, life ſwéete, &amp; death bitter. Thy enemies ſhalbe they of thine owne houſhold, and of thy own kindred, no truſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, no comfort in the earth. Be not too bold of thy owne ſtrength, mightie pillers haue fallen downe. <hi>Peter</hi> an Apoſtle, and one of the chiefeſt and moſt bold and venterous, yet in time of triall was found nothing ſo, but rather weake and childiſh.

The matter is ſo notable, that although I be iudged too tedious, yet I muſt ſet it downe: and when you haue read it, I hope you will thinke neuer a whit the worſe of me. The matter is ſet downe as followeth.</p>
                     <p>All this while, the quéene and the biſhops, who had kept<note place="margin">This may ſerue for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate reading but not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</note> the archbiſhop almoſt now thrée yeares in priſon, ſeeing by no meanes they could preuaile with him, to turn him from his religion, did ſecretly ſuborne certaine men, which when they could not ouerthrow him by argumentes and diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould by intreatie and faire promiſes, or any other meanes allure him to recantation. For theſe men, wily enough for their own profit, perceiued how great a wound they ſhould receiue, if the archbiſhop had ſtoode ſtedfaſt in his ſentence: and contrariwiſe how great profit they ſhould get if he as the principall ſtandard-bearer ſhould ſing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treit. By reaſon whereof, the wilie papiſtes, flocked about him, labouring by threatning, flattering, entreating, and
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:7821:251"/>
promiſing, and all other meanes, eſpecially <hi>Henry Sydall,</hi> &amp; Friar <hi>Iohn</hi> a Spaniard, <hi>De villa baccina,</hi> that they might driue him from his former ſentence to recantation. They ſet foorth how acceptable it would be both to the King and Quéene, and eſpecially howe gainfull to him, and for his ſoules health it would be. They added moreouer, how the Councell and Noble men beare him good will. They put him in hope, that he ſhould not only haue his life, but alſo be reſtored to his auncient dignitie. Saying it was but a ſmall matter, an ſo eaſie, that they required him to do, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he would ſubſcribe to a fewe words with his owne hand. Which if he did, there ſhuld be nothing in the realm, that the Quéene would not eaſily graunt him, whether he would haue riches or dignitie, or elſe if he had rather leade a priuate life in quiet reſt, in what place ſoeuer he liſted, without all publike miniſtery, only that he would ſet his name in two words to a little leafe of paper. But if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, there was no hope of health &amp; pardon; for the Quéene was ſo purpoſed, that ſhe would haue <hi>Cranmer</hi> a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or elſe no <hi>Cranmer</hi> at all. Therefore he ſhould chooſe, whether he thought it better to ende his life ſhortly in the flambes and firebrands now readie to be kindled, then with much honour to prolong his life, vntill the courſe of nature did call him. For there was no middle way. Moreouer they exhorted him, that he would looke to his wealth, his eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quietneſſe, ſaying he was not ſo old, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares yet remained in this his ſo luſtie age. And if he would not do it in reſpect of the Quéene, yet he ſhould do it for reſpect of his owne life, and not ſuffer that other men ſhould be more carefull for his health, then he was himſelf. Saying that this was agréeable to his notable learning and vertues, which being adioyned with his life, wold be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table both to himſelf, and to many other. But being extinct by death, ſhould be fruitfull to no man; that he ſhould take good héede, that he went not too farre, yet there was time inough to reſtore all things ſafe, and nothing wanted, if he
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:7821:252"/>
wanted not to himſelfe. Therefore they would haue him to lay hold vpon the occaſion of his health while it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, leſt if he would nowe refuſe it while it was offered, he might héereafter ſéeke it, when he could not haue it. Finally if the deſire of life did nothing moue him, yet he ſhould remember, that to die is gréeuous in all ages, and ſpecially in theſe his yeares and flower of dignitie, it were more gréeuous; but to die in the fire and ſuch tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is moſt gréeuous of all.</p>

It might be ſuppoſed, that it was done for the hope of life and better daies to come. But as we may ſince perceiue by a letter of his ſent vnto a lawier, the greateſt cauſe why hee deſired his time to be delaied, was that he would make an end of <hi>Marcus Anthonius,</hi> which he had begunne.

Yet more néerely it is taken for the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that dwell in the world. Alſo the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes and faſhions of the people, are meant by this word world. According to our prouerbe and vſuall phraſe; This is the world, that is, this is the dealing of the men in the world, and this is practiſed now adaies. Againe, it is taken for a ſpéech of woonder. It is a world to ſée, that is, it is a maruellous matter. Alſo for thoſe chiefe deſires wherwith men are much led and ouertaken in the world, as honour, dignitie and promotion, riches, pleaſures. All which are of chiefeſt account, and doe moſt raigne in the world. Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by S. <hi>Iohn. 1. Ep. cap. 2. ver. 15. Loue not the world, neither the thinges that are in the world. If any man loue the world, the loue of the father is not in him. For all that is in the world, as the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eies, and the pride of life</hi> (that is, ambition, promotion, and honour) <hi>is not of the father, but is of the world. And the world paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, and the luſt thereof, but hee that fulfilleth the will of God abideth for euer.</hi> Elſwhere it ſignifieth the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of worldly minded men. 1. <hi>Cor. 1. 21. <hi>For ſeeing the world by wiſedome knew not God in the wiſdome of God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſaue them that beleeue.</hi> &amp; ca. 26. <hi>And we ſpeake wiſedome among them that are perfect, not the wiſedome of this world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Princes and great men of this world which come to nought.</hi>
                        </hi> Sometimes it is taken for the elect people of God, according to that we reade, <hi>Iohn 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loued

the world that he hath giuen his only begotten ſonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh but haue life euerlaſting.</hi>
                        </hi> And although it be manifeſt that Chriſt his death is ſufficient for all, yet this benefite of his death doth rather properly pertaine to the elect, that is to them that truely and vnfainedly haue repented them of their ſinnes, applying the mercies of God in Ieus Chriſt to the comfort of their diſtreſſed ſoules, and relying and depending wholly vpon Gods promiſes. But moſt commonly it is taken for the worſer ſort of the people in the world. As it is ſaid that Sathan is the prince of this world. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Nay the God of the world, becauſe the moſt part ſerue him more then then God, and in whoſe heartes and mindes and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he doth both rule and raigne. The godly are againſt him and againſt his procéedinges, and therefore by this word world, the godly in the world are not meant, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppoſed againſt them that liue in the world. Which is confirmed by the ſpéech of our Sauiour in his praier to God for the elect and godly. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>I pray for them which haue knowne me &amp; beleeued in me, I pray not for the world.

of diuine ſeruice, when we ſhould there be preſent to offer vp our praier to God, and to ſing foorth his praiſes; in the Churches there are handfulles, and at ſtages and beare-baitings multitudes. Which ſheweth where the hearts of the worlde are ſet, and wherein their reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing conſiſteth. Well were it if they could remember that the way to heauen is narrow, and that fewe finde it, and that the way to hell is broade, and that manie paſſe by it, nay rather thruſt and throng into it. This if they could conſider, would abate their worldly reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and make them withdrawe themſelues from ſuch paſtimes which are ſo hurtfull, and make them turne their reioycing into heauineſſe, and their mirth into mourning. But as the Heathen painted their imagined fortune blinde, ſo is the wilfull world blind; and knoweth not, or at leaſt wiſe will not ſée, that their mirth ſhall end in heauineſſe. And becauſe they haue eies to ſée and will not ſée, and eares to heare and will not bee admoniſhed, hearts to conceiue, and will not relent, therefore their ſinne remaineth. The world lieth in ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">Sinfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> and all their reioycing is in ſinfull matters, as though they had not only bene conceaued, but bred and brought vp in ſinne. The Vſurer laugheth in his ſléeue at his extreame extortion, and delighteth himſelfe in his ſwéete or bitter gaine, and in the ouerthrow of others. For if other bee vndone he careth not, ſo that his turne be ſerued; the adulterers and adultereſſes, reioyce in their vncleanneſſe; the proude perſon in his brauery; the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in his riotouſneſſe; the couetous man in his miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe; the enuious in his mallice; the liar in his falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; the blaſphemer in his vaine ſwearing; the ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer in his backbiting; the théefe in his ſtealing; the robber in his ſpoyling; the craftie in his deceiuing; the pilferer in his purloyning; the corrupt perſon in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of bribes; and the reſt of the vngodly rout, reioyce and ſport themſelues in their manifold iniquities.

And as for the ſeruice of God and true religion, they make a mocke thereof, making it their only ſport and table talke, to ieſt and ſcoffe at all godlineſſe, and at the profeſſors therof. When they ſhould wéepe &amp; lament for their ſinnes, and for the gréeuous puniſhments and iudgements which hang ouer their heads, then is there nothing ſo rife with them as iolitie and ioy.

But this of all other is worthy the marking, that the wicked are neuer more giuen to ioy, then when their deſtruction is néereſt at hand.

Which is notably declared in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke of <hi>Wiſdom, <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> Come ſay they, let vs enioy our pleaſures, and fill our ſelues with coſtly wine and oyntments, let vs crowne our ſelues with roſe buds, and let vs be partakers of our wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Yet all theſe did not ſo much reioyce them, as to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the poore that was righteous, and to vexe them that were iuſt. Therefore let vs defraud y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteous ſay they, for he is not for our profit, and he is contrary to our doings; he checketh vs for offending againſt the lawe, and blameth vs as tranſgreſſors againſt diſcipline, he is made to reproue our thoughts, and it gréeueth vs to looke vpon him.

Wherein doe hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites more reioyce, then in the falſe and counterfait ſeruice of God, and they that kill the godly, ſhall thinke they doe God ſeruice. The wealth of the Iſraelites inriched the Chaldeans, but to mocke at their Saboths, that reioyced them, and to make a ieſt of their excerciſes of religion, was vnto them as their meate and drinke.

And he ſaid vnto them; <hi>The Lord is witneſſe againſt you, and his annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is witneſſe this day, that yee haue founde nought in my hands.</hi> And they anſwered, he is witneſſe. Sée how he dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles it, and almoſt trebles it, and makes it all his ſong, and the crowne of his reioicing. Whoſe example the Apoſtle S. Paul following, at his departure from the Epheſians, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſet downe, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 17. amongeſt the reſt hath theſe words. <hi>And now brethren I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build further, and to giue you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified, I haue coueted no mans ſiluer nor golde, nor apparrell, yea you knowe that theſe handes haue miniſtred vnto my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. I haue ſhewed you all things, and haue kept backe nothing, but haue ſhewed you all the counſell of God. Wherefore I take you to reccord this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</hi> And not only the ſoule of man which is the chiefeſt part within him, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth at the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, but alſo
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:7821:257"/>
this ioy is ſéene in his countenance, and in his louely beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, which is meant by that ſaying ſet downe, <hi>Prou. 15. 13. <hi>A ioyfull heart, maketh a cheerfull countenance.</hi>
                        </hi> This is it whereby we are holy temples vnto the Lord, and whereby we ſanctifie the Lord as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. Who alſo in the ſame chapter ſetteth downe two notable effects of a good conſcience, which cannot but bring great ioy to the godly. The one is, that when we be euill ſpoken of without deſert, then is the teſtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the chiefeſt comfort. The other is, concerning prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; A good conſcience maketh requeſt vnto God, and when we haue an euill conſcience, with what heart ſhall we offer vp our praiers to God, or how ſhal they be accepted at gods hand? According to that we reade, <hi>Iob.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>If thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thine heart, and ſtretch out thine hand toward him, if iniquitie be in thine hand, put it farre away.</hi> And therefore <hi>Mardocheus</hi> is bold to come into Gods preſence, vnder the warrant of a good conſcience <hi>(Heſter 13. 12.) <hi>Thou knoweſt</hi>
                        </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all things, and thou knoweſt Lord, that it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mallice nor preſumption, nor for any deſire of glorie, that I did this, and not bowe downe to proud <hi>Haman.</hi> For I would haue bene content with a good will, for the ſaluation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to haue kiſt the ſole of his feete. But I did it becauſe I would not preferre the honor of a man aboue the glory of God, and would not worſhip any but onely thee my Lord. And this haue I not done of pride.</hi> Séeing therefore the ioy of a good conſcience is ſo great, well might the wiſe man ſay, <hi>Pro. 15. 15. <hi>A good conſcience is a continuall feaſt, and the greateſt comfort in the greateſt trouble, and ſuch a comfort that the world cannot giue.</hi>
                        </hi> The ioy and comfort whereof, may appeare by the contrary in the wicked. For where the want of a good conſcience is, there is neither ioy nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but feare and ſorrow. As we reade, <hi>Prou. 15. 13. <hi>A ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart maketh a cheerfull countenance, but by the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the heart, the mind is heauie.</hi>
                        </hi> And <hi>Iob. 11. 20. <hi>The eies of the wicked ſhall faile, and their refuge ſhall periſh,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:7821:258"/>
and their hope ſhall be ſorrow of minde.</hi>
                        </hi> An ill conſcience bringeth great dumpes, and the heart of the people is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therewith. And this is one of the chiefeſt iudgements that God doth lay vpon the wicked, as we may reade <hi>Wiſd. 17. <hi>That they were ſick and died for feare, and they ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when a ſodaine feare, not looked for came vpon them.</hi>
                        </hi> For it is a fearefull thing when malice is condemned by her owne teſtimonie, and a conſcience that is touched doth euer forecaſt cruell thinges. By the which feare, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which reaſon offereth are betraied: for indéede no reaſon can allay the force therof, but only the grace and good ſpirite of God, which is farre from the obſtinate and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinner. Whoſe hope the leſſe it is within, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doe the tormentes to come ſéeme vnto them. Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is full of feare and giueth teſtimonie of damnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelfe, and a troubled conſcience alway ſuſpecteth cruell matters to be imminent, and to hang ouer it ſelfe, as it maketh account to haue deſcrued. The miſerable eſtate of a wicked mans conſcience is alſo liuely deſcribed, <hi>Iob.</hi> 15 in theſe wordes. <hi>A wicked man is prooued all the daies of his life, though time be vncertain how long he ſhall play the tyrant.</hi> The ſound of terror and feare is alwaies in his eares, and although it be in time of peace, yet he alway ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth ſome treaſon againſt him, expecting on euery ſide the ſword to come vpon him. When hee ſitteth downe to eate he remembreth that the day of darkneſſe is ready at hand for him, tribulation terrifieth him, and anguiſh enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneth him, euen as a king is enuironed with ſouldiers, when he goeth to war. What can be more miſerable then that man, that hath ſuch a butchery and ſlaughterhouſe within his own heart? What are his fearee, how great are his anguiſhes? Suſpecting all things, doubting their own ſhadowes, fearing euery little noiſe, thinking euery one to come againſt them that come toward them, and others that talke togither to talke of them and their ſins. Such a thing ſin is, that it bewraieth it ſelfe, though no man accuſe it, it
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:7821:258"/>
condemneth it ſelfe, though no man beare witneſſe againſt it. <hi>Pro. 28. <hi>The wicked man flieth thogh no man purſue him.</hi>
                        </hi> And why doth he flie? Becauſe that he hath within his conſcience an accuſer purſuing him, whom alwaies he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth about him. And as he cannot flie from himſelfe, ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he flie from his accuſer, but whereſoeuer he goeth he is purſued and whipped by the ſame, &amp; his wonnd incurable. And wherehence groweth all this feare, but only becauſe our conſciences ſhalbe our greateſt accuſers at the day of iudgement, as we reade <hi>Reuel. 20. 12: <hi>And I ſaw the dead both great and ſmall ſtand before God, and the bookes (of their conſciences) were opened, and the dead were iudged of thoſe things which were written in thoſe bookes according to their workes.</hi>
                        </hi> Now therfore it appeareth, that one of the chiefeſt ioyes of the godly is the teſtimonie of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is only proper to the godly, and vnto the which the wicked can in no ſort attaine. Without the which there is nothing but the feare of death and damnation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let euerie one haue care to make a good conſcience his only ioy, and let all our works be ruled thereby, without the which all things no doubt, ſhall go farre out of ſquare.</p>
                     <p>The ioy alſo of the godly conſiſteth in this, that they<note place="margin">The glorie of God.</note> turne all their ioy to the ſetting forth of Gods glory. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example <hi>Hamah</hi> the mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who being in great ſorrowe of minde, becauſe ſhe was barren and wanted the ioy of children, ſhe made her humble and earneſt requeſt vnto god to make her a ioyful mother. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing therewithall, that if God would vouchſafe to graunt her a child, that ſhe would him to the Lord and conſecrate him to his ſeruice. Contrary to the courſe of the wirked, and the faſhion of the world which periſheth, who réferre and apply all their ioy, to the fulfilling of their pleaſures, and the ſaiſfying of their luſtes. Which thing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doth worthily reproue in them. <hi>Chap. 4. 3. 4. <hi>Yee aske and receiue not, becauſe ye aske amiſſe, that yee might conſume it on your luſtes.
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:7821:259"/>
Ye adulterers and adultereſſes, know ye not that the amitie of the world, is the enmitie of God? Whoſoeuer therefore will be a friend of the world, maketh himſelfe the enemy of God.</hi>
                        </hi> Looke what ye ſowe ye ſhall reape, if ye ſéeke Gods glory, ye ſhall reape honour; and if your ioy bee ſetled in worldly and ſinfull matters, your ioy ſhall be turned into ſhame.</p>
                     <p>And herehence ariſeth another kind of ioy of the godly,<note place="margin">Heauenly bleſſings.</note> who counting worldly ioyes but ſinne and ſhame, or at leſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe but friuolous &amp; vaine, haue reſolued with themſelues to ſettle all their delight in heauenly bleſſings and inward comforts, and in ſuch things wherin the wicked hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. As in praier to God, in ſinging Pſalmes, in hearing his word, in reading his lawe. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in the lawe of the Lord, and who meditateth therein day and night.</hi> And ſéeing they are riſen with Chriſt, they ſéeke thoſe things which are aboue, their treaſure is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen where their heart is. As for the earth, they ſée that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo rife there, as corruption, ſinne, and vanitie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to be deliuered from this bodie of ſinne, and from this vale of miſery. Let him that hath bought a yoke of oxen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce to proue them; let him that hath purchaſed a farme, make haſt to furniſh it, and to poſſeſſe it; let him that hath newly married a wife, weary himſelfe in his blinde plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; let him that hath ſtore of corne, take care to build new barnes; let him that hath wealth and riches and great ſtore, reſt himſelfe thereupon. But let as many as are well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſay:</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>The greater ſort craue worldly goods,</l>
                        <l>and riches do imbrace:</l>
                        <l>But Lord grant vs thy countenance,</l>
                        <l>thy fauour and thy grace.</l>
                     </lg>

                        <l>For thou thereby ſhalt make my heart,</l>
                        <l>more ioyfull and more glad:</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="499" facs="tcp:7821:259"/>Then they that of their corne and wine,</l>
                        <l>full great increaſe haue had.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>The Apoſtles wiſhing ioy to them that they wrote vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, mention not any worldly matters, but the things that they wiſh vnto them are; <hi>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> They pray that God would open the eies of their minde, and increaſe his knowledge in them. How without our deſert he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen vs vnto life before the foundations of the world, how through his mercie and precious death of his deare ſonne, we are redéemed and ſaued. How of the enemies of God we are made his deare children by adoption, howe by his grace and holy ſpirit, we are not only called, but alſo direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into newneſſe &amp; holineſſe of life; how by his prouidence he ſuffereth vs not to want, as alſo by the ſame, how he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth away all hurtfull things from vs; and laſtly, how he nouriſheth and cheriſheth within vs, the ſtedfaſt hope of the life to come. That we may reioyce with the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph. 1. 2. <hi>Bleſſed be God, euen the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſings, in heauenly things in Chriſt.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherein although our chiefeſt ioy ought to be placed in heauenly things, yet are we to be aduiſed that we do not make too baſe account, and too vile a reckoning of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and bleſſings, which God hath graunted to vs in this world. As to enioy publike peace, and quietneſſe, to haue obedient wiues, and tractable children, truſtie ſeruants, and faithfull friends; and ſuch like tokens of Gods fauoure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs. And therefore hath God granted vs wiſedom to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeme of euery thing in his due place. For if concerning thoſe creatures of God, which we think to be altogither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, the wiſe man willeth vs, not curiouſly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully to aſke; What is this? wherefore is that? For God hath made all things for their owne vſe; howe much
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:7821:260"/>
more concerning the bleſſings of this life, ought we reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to be affected, and alſo thankfully to accept of them. But al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioy of the godly concerning theſe worldly matters and bleſſings of this life, is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſober &amp; moderat vſe of them, wheras the wicked do abuſe them to riot and exceſſe. Wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting them from thoſe ends for the which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; which are, his glorie, our comfort, and the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all benefit one of an other. Wherin the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29. doth wiſely counſel vs. <hi>This ſay I brethren, becauſe the time is ſhort, heereafter that both they which haue wiues, bee as though they had none, and they that reioyce, as they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced not, and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not, and they that vſe this world, as though they vſed it not. For the faſhion of this world goeth away,</hi> and here we haue no certaine dwelling place. Whereas the ioy of the wicked in theſe worldly bleſſings (which are no bleſſings to them, but matters of further condemnation for their abuſing of them) is out of meaſure, and altogither ſinful. Such as was in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> they ate, they dranke, they married, and gaue in marriage; and ſuch as was in the daies of <hi>Lot,</hi> they bought, they ſold, they planted, they built, their hearts being oppreſſed with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, and they altogither ouercome and drowned in the cares of this life, euen then, when the latter day, and the day of their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did ſuddeinly come vpon them.</p>
                     <p>To theſe may be added another ioy, as comfortable to the<note place="margin">Reioyce in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</note> ſoule &amp; conſcience of a godly man, as any of the reſt. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is when they reioyce of their infirmities. Not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> any ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in their ſins, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by the grace of God, &amp; by the power of his holy ſpirit, we haue the maſtry ouer thoſe ſins, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue manifeſt proofe in our ſelues, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they would haue the maſtry ouer vs, wherby we ſhould become y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bondſlaues of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diuel, and wherby we ſhuld throw our ſelues headlong into hell. Wicked inclinations grow with vs euen from the cradle, which as time &amp; age, and yéeres, procéed &amp; come on, take ſtrength &amp; begin to maſter vs, and rule vs. Our field is
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:7821:260"/>
all growne ouer with thiſtles and thornes, and our life is nothing elſe but a platforme of vices. And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions in man are mingled in the conſtitution of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of man, yet one quallitie is predominant &amp; ruleth the reſt; (for either we are ſanguine and pleaſant, or cholericke and angry, or melancholicke and ſad, or phlegmaticke and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie:) ſo is the ſoule of man infected with the pollution of ſinne, and with the mingle mangle of naughtie corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he can diſcern no remnant of that perfection wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was firſt created, that you may well ſay, the ſoule of man is nowe become a mixture of ſinnes, yet one ſinne among the reſt, challengeth the chéefeſt roome, and beareth the greateſt ſway. One is giuen to pride, and euerie one noteth him by that vice, another to drunkenneſſe, and hée is knowne to be a toſſepoſſe; another to theft and robbery, and he is pointed at and priuily marked for that; another to fighting, and he is called a ſlaſher and a ſwingbuckler; another to whoredome, and the beaſt is ſpued at, and his company loathed for ſuſpition of a French diſeaſe; and ſo in all vices, if a man liſt to runne through them. Wherin the wicked folow the courſe of their wicked nature, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> with a great delight &amp; felicitie, as though it were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only ioy to be deſired, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> with ſuch gréedines, as though they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ſatiſfied, and withal, ſuch blindnes &amp; headlong affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that may wel be pitied, but it is a doubt it will neuer be amended, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in mercy they might be ſaued. That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle might wel ſay of them, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. that they are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſnare of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel &amp; are taken of him at his wil. Yea they reioyce in his ſeruice, and wil by no means be deliuered, although they be neuer ſo much perſwaded therunto, no not after ſeuen &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yéeres, but offer their eares to be bored through, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of perpetual ſeruice, and ſell themſelues to worke wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, as <hi>Achab</hi> did that wicked King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some will ſay it is an eafie matter for a man to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his ſinfull affections, and wee may doo well if wee will. But I aſke them who was more able and better
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:7821:261"/>
furniſhed, then the bleſſed Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> yet he findeth the matter ſo hard to performe, that he confeſſeth it to the whole world. <hi>Rom. 11. 22. <hi>I delight in the law of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the inner man, but I ſee an other lawe in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, rebelling againſt the lawe of my minde, and leading me captiue vnto the lawe of ſinne which is in my members, that is in all the ſences, and in all the parts of my bodie.</hi>
                        </hi> Yea he ſeeth it to be a matter ſo impoſſible, that he is faine to crie out; <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me?</hi> And ſeeth no other meane of deliueraunce, but only praier for Gods helpe, that it would pleaſe God to beate downe the power of ſinne in him. I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And anſwere was made; <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, and my power is made perfect through thy weakneſſe.</hi> For that which is impoſſible to man, is moſt eaſie for God to bring to paſſe. Moſt truly therefore might he ſay; Very gladly will I reioyce, rather in mine infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the power of Chriſt may dwell in me, and maſter and mortifie ſinne, which would full faine haue the better hand ouer me. Many will not be knowne of their ſinnes, when they be admoniſhed of them, becauſe they are loth to leaue them, yet ſome of a better minde and more tractable, will acknowledge them, and in their minde will miſlike them, and alſo will not ſticke to confeſſe that they would faine leaue them, and would thinke themſelues happie, if they might be rid of them, yet find in themſelues no power at all to forgo them. No maruell then though the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. perſwadeth vs to caſt off ſinne, which cleaneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs and hangeth on ſo faſt. But how may we forgo them? how may we be rid of them? we cannot, it is impoſſible to vs. Craue it and beg it as the apoſtle did, once, twice, thrice, yea often &amp; euer, at the hands of God, in earneſt and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble praier, and he will performe it vnto thée, and after a while thou ſhalt perceiue how weake the power of ſin will begin to be in thée. So that thou ſhalt be daily leſſe proude, leſſe giuen to drunkenneſſe, to theft, to whoredome, and the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:7821:261"/>
like, till thou groweſt at the laſt to hate that ſin, that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thy ſoule ſo much, till in time thou haſt gathered that ſtrength, that thou maieſt diſpoſſeſſe and throwe out that ſtrong man. Behold then how great cauſe the godly haue to reioyce at their infirmities, in that not only the power of their ruling ſinnes is abated, but alſo by the power of Gods good ſpirit, and by the grace of Chriſt who dwelleth in the harts of the godly, they are quite ouercome and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. Whereby we may gather theſe two comforts; Firſt that this is a ſure token vnto vs, that we appertaine vnto God; and ſecondly, that the diuel ſhall haue no power to deſtroy vs, ſéeing that we haue eſcaped his ſnares, and that his bands that held vs in ſo faſt, are looſed, burſt, and broken.</p>
                     <p>I will adde but one ioy more, which is moſt pertinent<note place="margin">To do good for euill.</note> and for the preſent purpoſe. And that is, that the godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce to do the wicked good, as the wicked reioyce to hurt them, and ſport and ſolace themſelues in their ſorrowes. At the conuertion of the ſinner and wicked, the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen reioyce, and it is not to be doubted, but that the godly beare them company heerein, and are as greatly ioyfull. The enemy of the Prophet <hi>Eliſeus</hi> ſought his death, but he ſet bread &amp; water before them, and ſent them away in peace, when they were al in his hand, and at his word they might haue bene put to death. When <hi>Dauid</hi> might haue ſaline <hi>Saul,</hi> yet he reioyced in preſeruing his life. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> counſelled the Iſraelies to pray for the life of King <hi>Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> who held them in captiuitie, although he were a wicked and an idolatrous King. Our Sauiour Chriſt praied for the life of his perſecutors; <hi>O Lord laie not this ſinne to their charge, for they know not what they do.</hi> So did the bleſſed Martyr S. <hi>Stenen,</hi> when the ſtones flue thicke about his eares. Thus doo they pray for them that perſecute them, that God would turn his wrath from them, and that in mercy he would call them, as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was called from perſecution, to profeſſion; thus doo

they ſpeake well of them that hate them, bleſſe them that curſe them; thus do they good for euil, and ſéeke the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of their liues, who gréedily hunt after their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw &amp; death. According to the examples of the Apoſtles, 1. <hi>Cor. 4. 12. <hi>We are reuiled and yet we bleſſe; we are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and ſuffer it; we are euill ſpoken of, and we pray. I ſay the truth in Chriſt,</hi>
                        </hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul,) Rom. 9. 1. <hi>I lie not, my conſcience bearing mee witneſſe in the holie Ghoſt, that I haue great heauineſſe and continual ſorrow in my heart. For I would wiſh my ſelf to be ſeperate from Chriſt for my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that are my kinſmen according to the fleſh: but his profeſſed and vtter enemies by perſecution.</hi>
                        </hi> Yet he calleth them brethren. <hi>Brethren, my hearts deſire and praier to God for <hi>Iſrael</hi> is, that they might bee ſaued.</hi> Accounting the good and welfare of his enemies, the greateſt ioy that might befall him.</p>
                     <p>More might be ſaid, but I haue ſtood vpon this point of the ioy of the godly ſomewhat too long.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore as a matter more proper to the godly, I will<note place="margin">The ſorrow of the godly.</note> returne vnto the words of my text, and intreat once againe of their ſorrow. <hi>The world ſhall reioyce, and ye ſhall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:</hi> as if they were both borne and bred to it, and ſhould end their liues in the ſame. For as the oxen appointed to the ſlaughter are let runne a fatting at their pleaſure, and other oxen kept vnder daily labour of the yoke, ſo fareth it with the godly, that are exerciſed with trouble all the daies of their life, while the wicked eſcape &amp; run at randam, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering fat, and growing groſſe, &amp; dying ſhortly, nay more then that, eternally. If the godly haue any comfort in this world, it continueth not long, and therefore their life may well be ſaid, to be a mixture of ſwéet &amp; ſoure, and a continual interchange of ſorrow &amp; comfort, comfort &amp; ſorrow. Which if they conſider wel, is a benefit vnto them, ſo far forth as to draw their minds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth to heauen, from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world to God.

deriſion. As the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. hath foretold; We are counted as the filth of the worlde, and the ofſcouring of all things vnto this time, and a gazing ſtocke vnto the world. In the time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet <hi>Zachariah,</hi> they that followed the word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord were continued in the world, and eſtéemed as monſters. <hi>Heare now,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Zachariah, <hi>cap. 3. 8.)</hi> Heare now, ô Iehoſhua the high prieſt, thou and thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that ſit before thee, for they are monſtrous perſons.</hi> So likewiſe was it in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies of <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet, <hi>cap. 8. 18. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I and the children whom the Lord hath giuen me, are as ſignes, and as wonders in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſuch as are thought not worthie to liue.</hi>
                        </hi> Moreouer their eſtate in worldly matters, what is it but hunger, thirſt, nakedneſſe, impriſonment, to be buffetted, to haue no certain dwelling place. Be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid at this eſtate, but rather with <hi>Moſes</hi> frame thy ſelf to take part with the godly in their ſorrow, yea although thou mighteſt liue in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pallaces of princes. For he that will liue godly, muſt looke and make account of ſorrow, and ſéeke for no ioy. When <hi>Baruch</hi> was ſory becauſe he could not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his deſire and of his ioy, he had this anſwere from God, by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah; Seekeſt thou great things for thy ſelfe, ſeeke them not.</hi> Let vs remember what Chriſt ſaid; <hi>My kingdome is not of this world.</hi> And why ſhould the deſire of ioy ſo tickle our minds? or ſorrow daunt vs, and throw vs downe? or any griefe diſcourage vs? When all things goe according to our will, then doo we eaſily ſlide into the forgetfulneſſe of God, but ſorrow and miſerie maketh vs knowe God and our ſelues. <hi>I ſaid in my proſperitie</hi> (ſaieth <hi>Dauid) I ſhould neuer bee caſt downe; But it is good for mee that I haue bene troubled.</hi> And many there are, who haue giuen God more thankes for their ſorrow and miſery, then for all the proſperitie that euer they enioyed. So greatly it did inſtruct them, and ſo great good it did them. Sée howe profitable it is, to haue ſorrow rather then ioy. If our eſtate be ioyfull, and ſorrow dooth not aſſault vs, yet let vs wéepe with them that wéepe,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:7821:263"/>
and pray to God to turne away his heauie hand from them on whom he hath laid ſorrow. Let there be fellow-féeling in thée of the ſorrowes of others, as if the caſe were our owne, and let vs helpe to beare their burthen.</p>
                     <p>Conſider if thou canſt be without ſorrow, if thou coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thy ſelfe amongſt the number of thoſe that are godly. Record with thy ſelf what duties and good things thou haſt omitted which thou ſhouldeſt haue done, either to God or man, either to our ſelues or others, to our own charge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our hands, and to our gouernment, as wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſeruants, or to ſtrangers, to our friends, or to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Let vs call to mind what euil we haue done, wherby God hath bene diſhonoured, our neighbours iniuried, our ſelues defiled, other by our example allured to wickednes. Let vs not be wilfully forgetfull, that we haue omitted our dutie in praier and inuocation to God, and in performing our humble ſeruice vnto him. That we haue omitted the miniſtring to the neceſſitie of the Saints, and the helpe we ſhould haue ſhewed to the néedie brethren; that wee haue omitted many good opportunities which haue bene offered for the increaſe of our vertues, faith, patience, mercie, and ſuch like. That we haue neglected the carefull viſiting of the poore deſtitute, which lie in our ſtréetes and complaine for their great miſeries, and are readie to periſh before our eies for lacke of reliefe. That we haue omitted many exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of praier, of preaching, of reading and meditating in the law of God; that we haue omitted many things which appertaine to godlineſſe and true ſanctification. Againe, let vs remember on the other ſide, that we haue committed much wickedneſſe priuately, publikely, openly, ſecretly, in our ſoules, in our bodies, at home and abroad, againſt God and men, in our conuerſation, and in our communication. All which being duly conſidered, haue we not iuſt cauſe to chaſtice our ſelues by ſorrowe, and to afflict our ſelues by wéeping?</p>

Leſt as the world is lulleda ſléep, till their laſt ſléep come vpon them, ſo alſo they might grow in ſuch forgetfulnes, as to doubt whether there were a God that ruled the earth, whether euer they ſhould be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth by death, whether there were a iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t day, in the which they ſhould be called to an account, whether there were a heauen for the godly or a hell for the wicked.

God prolongeth his daies, I knowe it ſhall bee well with them that feare the Lord and do reuerence before him.

This hath troubled many in all ages, not only of the weaker ſort, but many of them alſo which haue bene ſtronger, <hi>Iob, Dauid, Ieremy,</hi> euen ſuch as haue bene partakers of Gods ſecretes.

Which made the Prophet Abacuc to crie out and ſay; <hi>O Lord how long ſhall I crie, and thou wilt not heare? euen crie out vnto thee for violence, and thou wilt not helpe? Why doeſt thou ſhewe mee iniquitie, and cauſe me to behold ſorrow? for ſpoyling and violence are before mee, and there are that raiſe vp ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi> Therefore the lawe is diſſolued, and iudgement doth neuer goe foorth. For the wicked doth compaſſe about the righteous, therfore wrong iudgement proceedeth. The oppreſſion of the poore and of the godly is a crying ſinne, and pierceth the cloudes, and howe can it but pierce thy heart to heare of it, much more to behold it? This made Quéene <hi>Heſter</hi> when ſhée heard of the cruell decrée againſt the Iewes to be ſo ſadde and heauie, yea furthermore, to venture her life for the ſafegard of her people.

                     <p>Who would thinke that the wicked ſhould haue any ſorrow in this world, howſoeuer they are like to ſpéed in the world to come, ſéeing they haue the world at will, and as the Prophet ſaith, they come in no miſfortune like other men. And yet it falleth out ſometimes, that they haue ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but what is the cauſe of their ſorrow? No other but for worldly matters, for temporall loſſes, and that their tranſitorie ioyes are abated and diminiſhed. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when their goods are taken by pirates, their wealth conſumed by ſhipwracke, their houſes burnt with fire, their landes taken from them by violent oppreſſion, their riches waſted by vſurie, their libertie reſtrained by impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, their children to miſcarry ſuddeinly, their friends either to die or to fall away from them daily, as the wiſe man ſaith; <hi>In proſperitie a friend cannot bee knowne, and in aduerſitie and calamitie, a mans verie friend will fall away from him, and forſake him.</hi> Now when theſe miſeries, and theſe worldly calamities come vppon them, what cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what wringing of hands, what lamenting, what wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is there among them? But that God by their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe is offended, his name through them blaſphemed, his lawe and holy word contemned, his patience and long ſufferance daily prouoked and abuſed, his threatnings, his admonitions, his counſels neglected; his louing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies forgotten, and his great benefits not remembred; that many good things pertaining to our dutie, haue bin through our follies omitted; and many wickedneſſes whereof we ſhould haue bene cleare, committed by vs, who wéepeth for theſe matters? who lamenteth for theſe cauſes? The world reioyceth in hurting the godly, and if their miſchiefe and their mallice be preuented, then are they ſorry for nothing more, then that they can do no more hurt, nor any more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, where the godly pray for them &amp; their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion. How do they enuy &amp; maligne thoſe perſons in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſée Gods gifts &amp; graces?

For God ſhal turn all to his glorie and their good, as is in his good pleaſure determined of them. And as they cannot abide the godly, ſo ſecretly in their hearts they hate God, as their déedes and workes declare; for if the loue of God were in them, the fruites therof would alſo appeare. For who are more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to heare Gods word, to be preſent at his diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, who make leſſe accompt of chriſtian profeſſion? yea they hate it, they ſcoffe and ſcorne it, and they that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell them to religion &amp; goodneſſe are their chiefeſt enemies. King <hi>Dauid</hi> bearing the perſon of the godly, was otherwiſe minded, who counted it his great ſorow, that he was debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a time from Gods ſeruice. <hi>Pſ. 48. 3. <hi>O Lord of hoſtes, how amiable are thy tabernacles! my ſoule longeth, yea and fainteth for the courts of the Lord, for my heart &amp; my fleſh reioyce in the liuing God. Yea the ſparrow hath found her an houſe, and the ſwallow a neaſt for her, where ſhe may lay her yoong ones, euen by the altars ô Lord of hoſtes, my king and my God.</hi>
                        </hi> But becauſe the wicked are ſo ſet againſt God, &amp; good men, therefore the Prophet ſaid truely of them. Many are the ſorrowes and great are the plagues that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for the wicked. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32. 10. Which is moſt effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 40. <hi>Great trauell is created for all men, and an heauie yoke vpon the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> from the day that they go out of their mothers wombe, til the day they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the mother of all things.</hi> Namely, their thoughtes and feare of the heart, and the imagination of the thinges they waite for, and the day of death. From him that fitteth vpon the glorious throne, vnto him that is beneath in the earth and aſhes. Wrath and enuy, trouble, and vnquietnes, and feare of death, &amp; rigor and ſtrife. And in the time of reſt, the ſléepe in the night vpon his bed change his knowledge.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:7821:268"/>
A little or nothing is his reſt, &amp; afterward in ſléeping, he is as in a watch-tower in the day. He is troubled with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his heart, as one that runneth out of a battell. And when all is ſafe, he awaketh and maruelleth that the feare was nothing. Such things come vnto all fleſh, but ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to the vngodly. There is no peace (ſaith the Lord) vnto the wicked: Yea though they ſéeke peace and reſt by many meanes, &amp; indeuour to caſt al troubleſome feare from them, now by inſtruments of muſicke, now by merrineſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, now by diuerſitle of repaſtes and paſtimes, nowe by drinking of wine and banquetting; yea though they ſhoote out feare, as by a double canon, and ſéeme to remooue all diſquietneſſe farre from them, and as it were, ſend it into baniſhment, yet it reconcileth and furneth backe vppon them. So that in their mirth there is ſorrowe, in their laughter there is griefe, and in their ioy there is heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which vexeth their heartes continually. This tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the inward ſorrowe of their heartes and mindes, and as for any outward ſorrow, they had rather be cut off by preſent death then to indure it. King <hi>Zedekiah</hi> being told by the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> that if hée went into captiuitie, and would endure ſome ſorrowe, he ſhould ſaue his life; the thought of ſorrow was ſo intollerable vnto him, that he had rather ſuffer preſent death, then to abide the leaſt taſte thereof. <hi>Iere. 8. 3. <hi>And death</hi>
                        </hi> (ſaith the Prophet,) <hi>ſhall rather be deſired then life, of all the reſidue that remaineth of this wicked familie, becauſe of the afflictions that God would ſend vpon them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, their ſorrowes are expreſſed in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by this word Woe. Chriſt ſaith to the godly, <hi>Ye ſhall</hi>

Which he ſaid not concerning the good and godly, who as he ſaith, were ſealed in their foreheades,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:7821:269"/>
and whoſe names were written in the booke of life; but of the wicked world, whoſe ſorrowes ſhould be mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. <hi>Bleſſed are ye</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>when men reuile ye, and ſpeake euill of ye for my names ſake.</hi> But vnto them of the world he ſaith; <hi>Woe bee vnto you when all men ſpeake well of you.</hi> That is, becauſe they fauour the wicked of the world, and goe after the world, and ſéeke friendſhip of the world, therefore the friendſhip of the world departeth from them. So true is that which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith; <hi>The amitie of the world, is the enmitie of God. Woe bee to you that now laugh, for you ſhall waile and weepe.</hi> The wéeping of the godly is with comfort, but the world and the wicked wéep without hope, thinking of Gods iudgements to come, which driue them to diſpaire, becauſe they are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, the wofull and euerlaſting wéeping and gnaſhing of téeth, ſhall come vppon them, and ſhall be their portion. The Prophet <hi>Eſay.</hi> 24. ſpeaketh of them of his time. The mirth of the world is gone away, becauſe they did not vſe Gods benefits aright. And after a while the liues of the world went away. Then what a ſorrow is it to leaue their luſts and their pleaſures, to leaue the world, their friends, their wife and children; their lands and poſſeſſions? And yet behold this is but the beginning of their ſorrowes. In the midſt of all their iolitie, the very thought of death doth ſtrike ſuch a dumpe into their mindes, that makes their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue ioy to vaniſh into wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh how bitter is the remembrance of death, to him that liueth at reſt in his poſſeſſions, that hath nothing to vexe him, and that hath proſperitie in all things. When the ſorrowe of death commeth in place, all our ioyes are gone which endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but for a moment of time, and were as a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the thing is farre worſe.

in the face (whom they would auoyd, if poſſibly they could) this I ſay is their ſorrow, that they ſhall depart from their earthly happineſſe, that they ſhall neuer ſée the face of their ioyes, pleaſures, and vanities, any more. The paine of the bodie, the feare of death, the ſight of thildren, the weeping of the wife, the flattery of the world, the temptation of the diuell, the diſſembling phiſitian, who for gaine dooth put him in hope of life. Sée how his ioyes are turned into ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and yet this is but the beginning of his ſorrow. For at the point of death theſe worldly griefes doo not ſo much vexe his minde, as the fearefull remembraunce of an euill life paſt, the day of iudgement, and that they ſhall be called to an account; the ougly ſight of hell in their conſciences, and the intollerable paines and torments which they ſhall hereafter ſuffer. The ſorrow of theſe things, at the very inſtant of their death, dooth ouercome the griefe of their diſeaſe and all other ſorrowes, yea and haſteneth on their death which otherwiſe might be prolonged. Whereas the godly as it is in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. reioyce and ſing loud in their beds, hauing a quiet conſcience, and that they ſhal paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vnſpeakable ioyes, from this vale of miſery, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome perſecuting world. Greatly reioycing, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinne, nor ſathan, nor hell, nor the torments thereof, ſhall preuaile againſt them, ſhall touch them, or come néere them, to hurt them.

ſelues in the battell, and in the face of the enemy to get a prize and winne the crowne. Againe, it is not one pangue and one throe, and then deliuerance; ſo many are the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the righteous, before God deliuer them out of all.

And let vs comfort our ſelues, for when our troubles are thickeſt, then are they ſhorteſt. For nothing that is violent is of long continuance. Our Sauiour Chriſt in the greateſt extremities, throes and pangues, and in the infinit number and huge heape of them, as the ſand of the ſea, and who can expreſſe hell torments; crieth out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> But anon after, he quietly gaue vp the ghoſt, ſaying moſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in the hearing of all the ſtanders by; <hi>All is finiſhed.</hi> Great and extreame are the pangues and throes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but lightly a day or two endes them.

may dwell with the Lord. The diuers throes which come without intermiſſion, procure great feare, but it is only in a womanly heart. Fleſh and blood is alwaies trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and where courage wanteth, there are great feares. Feares, yea and crying out, and ſkritching moſt pittiouſly, that it would grieue ones heart to heare it. Like as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with child ſaith y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Prophet, <hi>Eſay cap.</hi> 26. 17. that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neare to the trauel, is in ſorrow and crieth in her pains, ſo haue we bene in thy ſight O Lord. And here the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent minde of the godly, paſſeth in extremitie of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who beyond all expectation can reioyce and clap their hands, when as the wicked being put to the like, tremble and quake at the ſight, and roare out for paine, when they féele the ſmart. The reaſon is, that as God in iuſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the paines of the one, ſo in loue and mercy, hee mitigateth and aſſwageth the ſorrowes of the other, that although in their owne nature, they be bitter and extreme, yet in a manner they are not felt. Which is ſometimes alſo ſéene in the trauell of a woman, that when matters are thought to be impoſſible, not only to her but to the midwife and the ſtanders by, ſo that all hope of life doth vaniſh; when groning &amp; crying is turned to fainting, then behold the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine helpe of God to relieue her, and to bring her againe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life, to increaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wonder in the beholders, and to giue them all cauſe to giue God the praiſe &amp; thanks. For when we are weakeſt, then is he ſtrongeſt. When ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke is made, what ſhift is then vſed to recouer &amp; get to the ſhore, for fear of death which is at hand, and they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> could neuer ſwimme before, how do they catch hold of boords, and practiſe &amp; labour to ſwim; the cowardly ſouldier when he is in his enemies danger, and like to be murthered, how dooth he beſtir himſelfe, and in neceſſitie ſhewe himſelfe valiant, and all for feare of death. So is life ſwéete to the woman in trauell, and ſhe ſtriues and takes great paines, in hope that in time ſhe ſhall be deliuered and auoyd death. But when at laſt ſhe ſées all her paines taking in vaine, and that ſhe
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:7821:280"/>
cannot be deliuered, but of force muſt yéeld her laſt breath, alaſſe what lamentation and griefe ſhe makes for death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. Againe, as ſome take great paines, ſo ſome of them either dare not, or wil not put to their ſtrength to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, and for lacke of courage fall away. In ſorrow, and eſpecially in diſtreſſe of perſecution, let vs plaie the men, and be as painfull as the woman in trauell, if it be no more but for this, to ſaue our liues, I meane the life to come, which is wonne by painfulneſſe and courage, and alſo loſt by faintneſſe. For the nearer the trauell, the greater is the womans griefe and feare; and the nearer the triall of our death is, the more the fleſh is fraile. The children are come to the birth ſaith the Prophet, and there is no ſtrength to bring forth, vnleſſe God giue ſtrength. So we when we are brought to triall by death, then a hundreth to one, but we faint and are féeble, till God giue conſtancie &amp; courage, which through fearefulneſſe and faintneſſe of courage we reuolt, then death approacheth, yea a fearfull kind of death. For they ſaith Chriſt, that ſéeke to ſaue their life ſhall looſe it, and they that are deſirous to enioy this world, ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in an other. And then what pittious outcries ſhall we make, wéeping, and woe, and great lamentation? The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that muſt néeds die, through the ſore anguiſh that ſhe hath endured, yet if ſhe be deliuered and ſée her childe liue, it is her great ioy; but through faintneſſe of courage and for lack of paines taking, oftentimes it faileth out, that the childe dieth within her, and with her. The conſtant Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, that are deliuered by death, in the ſoreſt anguiſh and agony of death, this comforteth them, and that out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that their hope is with God, their good report with the faithfull, and that their labours ſhall follow them, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be loſt. But if either the loue of the world, lands, poſſeſſions, wife, and children, kinſfolke, friends &amp; acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hinder vs, or life it ſelfe, and feare of death, let vs then aſſure our ſelues that we haue loſt all. All the glory of our chriſtian profeſſion, our confident boaſting that we made to

endure perſecution, the good report and ioy of the godly, which by our conſtancie might haue béene ſo much the more comforted and confirmed, and eſpecially our hope with God, I would I could not ſay, that all theſe excellent matters fall to the ground, are void &amp; decaied, and that they all die together within them and with them. Let none take away thy crowne from thée, let nothing kéepe thée from thy excéeding reioycing, knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God hath promiſed vnto thée to be thy excéeding great reward.

the fight and combat there is ſorrow and hazard, but after the victorie, triumph and reioycing. And certainly after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and death, commeth life and ioy. And now let vs a litle behold the ioyes of a trauelling woman. One ioy is, the hope that ſhe ſhall be deliuered, which maketh her the more patiently to endure her trouble, ſtil looking when her houre will come, and waiting for the good houre that God ſhall ſend. For they that put their truſt in the Lord, ſhall ſurely haue helpe and deliuerance, ſo far as he ſeeth good for his glory and their comfort. Wait thou the Lords leiſure, and he ſhall giue thée thy hearts deſire. And becauſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie, God often turneth away his face, and leaueth vs to our ſelues and to our troubles, to ſinke or to ſwimme, get out how we can. But the patient abiding of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, maketh things impoſſible moſt comfortable, and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed caſes to haue gladſome iſſues.

                        <pb n="541" facs="tcp:7821:281"/>God hath appointed the woman to this ſorrow, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be a ioy, to ſhew her obedience in perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Gods will. And if ſhe pertaine to God, this ſhe may boldly ſay with the Apoſtle, that if ſhe liue, ſhe liues to the Lord: if ſhe die, ſhe dies to the Lord. Wherefore, whether ſhe liue or die, ſhe is the Lordes. Come life, come death, if Gods will be obeied, it is life and ioy, what euer falleth out. Such alſo ought our reſolution to be, with that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: We receiued the ſentence of death within our ſelues, knowing that we are appointed to theſe things as ſhéep for the ſlaughter. And if things come to paſſe beyond our expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the more ſhall we haue experience of Gods mercie and fauour, which imbraceth vs euen as the tender kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a father to a childe, who while he beateth, wéepeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, as Chriſt did ouer Ieruſalem, for louing affection, his good will toward vs is ſuch and ſo great. We are in the Lords hand, who in his good time will ſend ioy, what bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſoeuer of ſorrowe he lay vpon vs in the meane time. There is the houre of throes, there is alſo the inſtant of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance; the ſorrow is not ſo great, but the ioy alſo excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth in greatnes. And what are the afflictions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the godly in this world? is not the continuance thereof compared to a moment, which is afterward recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with an eternall waight of glorie? If the time of her deliuerance be long ere it commeth, yet is not too long that comes at laſt. According to that we reade, <hi>Pro. 13. 12. <hi>The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart; but when the deſire commeth, it is a tree of life.</hi>
                        </hi> The ioy of the godly although they long wayt for it, yet when it is come, it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth comfort enough euen at the ſodaine change, and at the very firſt taſte therof. There is a great paſſion, and we are mooued much at the firſt knowledge of ſorrowe or of ioy, which in time abateth more and more. King <hi>Belcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> at the firſt when that hée did ſee the hand writing on the wall, his countenance chaunged, and the ioyntes of his loynes were looſed, and his knees did ſmite one

againſt the other. Likewiſe alſo king <hi>Agag,</hi> at the firſt thought of ioy, that his life ſhould be preſerued, came foorth pleaſantly and ſaid. Truly the bitternes of death is paſſed. The very time of deliuerance doth bring with it the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt part of reioycing. Yea her reioycing is ſo great, that preſently vpon the féeling of this ioy, all ſorrow is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, not only that ſhe findeth preſent eaſe, but that ſhe is ſafe and well deliuered. Why therfore ſhould we not ſuffer ſorrow and affliction paciently, ſéeing that a moment of ioy will make vs forget all ſorrow, yea in a manner, that we had any ſorrow at all. And what can bee more ſafe and more ſure, then that which God kéepes, then that which God giues warrant for? I know to whom I haue committed my ſelfe, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. And the Lord will deliuer and will preſerue me vnto his heauenly kingdome, to whom be praiſe for euer and euer, <hi>Amen. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi>

                        <hi>Pharao</hi> made a cruell edict againſt the Iſraelites, that the men children ſhould be ſlaine, and the Midwiues that were appointed for that cruell decrée, refrained and gaue anſwer, that the women of the Hebrewes were not as the women of <hi>Egipt,</hi> for they were liuely &amp; were deliuered ere the Midwiues came at them. In like ſort alſo is the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that God ſheweth toward the godly. For oftentimes by Gods mercy and gracious prouidence, they are deliuered from great and mightie dangers, without the help of man, God taking the matter into his own hands. The Iſraelites deliuered from the Egiptians in the redde ſea, for God gaue paſſage; the thrée children in the firie furnace, for God ſent helpe.</p>
                     <p>Only this is to be marked and to be amended, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vpon ioy, we do not only forget all ſorrow, but alſo forget to giue him thankes, who is the authour and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our ioy. Are there not ten leapers healed, but where are the nine? Good reaſon it is that we be kept ſo long from ioy, becauſe we are ſo forgetfull to bee thankfull therefore.

                     <p>Of all the conſiderations why the ioy of a man-childe ſhould be ſo great, I may recite theſe two.

Beſides this, the name of the godly is more durable and of longer continuance, he that will looſe his life ſhall ſaue it, he that eſtéemeth more of the fauour of God, then the fauour of the world, ſhall in this life haue ſorrowes and perſecutions, but in the life come ioyes.

How then could the Apoſtles chooſe but be ſorrie and wéep aboundantly at the departure of our Sauiour Chriſt, which was ſo deare a friend vnto them, and whoſe preſence they had ſo long enioyed, to their great comfort and contentment. Departure of louing friendes bréeds paine, and taking of leaue is often with great heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

They that are thus perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded leaue their ſorrow, and are contented with Gods will, and are alſo thankful, that it hath pleaſed God to take them to his mercy, and that he hath releaſed them out of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of this miſerable world. Yet are there ſome that are of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that euen in heauen alſo they ſhal haue knowledge, and ſée their friends again which are departed in the Lord, which is a matter to abate all ſorrow. Neuertheleſſe we may not imagine any worldly knowledge; For greater things are reſerued for the ſaints of God. According to that we reade, 2. <hi>Cor. 5. 16. <hi>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the fleſh, yea though we had knowne Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</hi>
                        </hi> Our Sauiour Chriſt when he departed from his Apoſtles, and was taken away by death, he tooke his leaue of them, but not his laſt farwell. <hi>After a while ye ſhall not ſee mee, and yet after a while ye ſhall ſee mee.</hi> Did not the holy Martyr S. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſée Ieſus ſtanding at the right hand of God?
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:7821:286"/>
And ſhall not the time come, that all the godly ſhal ſit with him in the kingdome of heauen? A friend being departed farre out of ſight and abiding in a ſtraunge land, our heart and delight being ſetled vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, how earneſt is our deſire to ſée him, and to talke with him, and to be in his preſence, yea if we can heare but any talke or tidings of him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any token from him, how greatly doth it reioyce vs? And all is, becauſe of the doubt and feare that holdeth our mindes that we ſhall ſée him no more. But if our friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous of our welfare, and for the bettering of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate do ſend vs word, what a fruitfull ſoile he dwelleth in, and howe he can prouide vs if wee will come vnto him, a place to dwell in, ſo that it ſhall be to our great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and good liking: not only the ioy of our friendes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence will moue our hearts, but alſo the bettering of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſhall cauſe vs to vndertake a long iourney, and that without weariſomeneſſe and fainting. And when we méet, what kiſſing, what ioy, what imbracing?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ye ſhall ſee mee a while</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and after a while ye ſhall not ſee mee, for I go to the father.</hi> Therefore he put forth this parable. <hi>A certaine noble man went into a farre country, to receiue for himſelfe a kingdome, and ſo to come againe, bringing rewards with him.</hi> For them, who by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in wel-doing, haue fought for glory, and honor, and immortalitie, and eternall life. Wherefore went Chriſt to his father, but to drawe vs vnto his father, that where the head is, there might the members be, and where he is, there might we be alſo. He went to receiue for himſelfe a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but when he was gone, did he forget vs? after the maner of the world. Out of ſight, out of mind. No he is moſt careful for vs. And although a mother may forget her child, yet will he not forget vs whom he hath written in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palme of his hand, and whome he remembreth and beholdeth as the ſignet on his right hand. <hi>Ioh. 14. 2. <hi>In my fathers houſe are many dwelling places, if it were not ſo I would haue told you, I go to prepare a place for you</hi>
                        </hi> (alſo as well as for my
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:7821:287"/>
ſelfe.) <hi>And though I goe to prepare a place, for you, I will come againe and receiue you vnto my ſelfe, that where I am there may ye be alſo.</hi> Now though he be abſent from vs, yet he remembreth vs, and ſendeth vs many tokens of his loue, to put vs in minde, that wee ſhall come to his ſight, to our great comfort. Which tokens, are his gifts and graces, benefits and bleſſings, daily poured vpon vs. But of all tokens this is the ſureſt, that he hath ſent his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirite into our hearts, to witneſſe vnto our ſpirtite, that we are his children, and ſhall alſo in time to come be heires of the kingdome. Whome although we doe not preſently ſée, yet are we in good hope that we ſhall ſée, and in the meane time, we muſt with patience abide for it.</p>
                     <p>They ſhall ſée him which put him to death, and pierced<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 39.</note> him through, but it ſhalbe litle to their comfort. But when we ſhall ſée him, then ſhall our ſorrow be turned into ioy, then ſhall we be caught vp into the clouds, to méet the Lord in the aire, and ſo ſhall we be euer with the Lord. Wherfore comfort your ſelues ſaith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle, one another, with theſe words. And though as yet we cannot ſée Chriſt, yet the time ſhall come that we ſhall ſée him face to face. In whoſe preſence is the fulneſſe of ioy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for euermore.</p>
                     <p>The next place of proofe is in theſe words; <hi>And your</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Your harts ſhall reioyce.</note> 
                        <hi>hearts ſhall reioyce.</hi> With how great ioy it is, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by theſe words of the wiſe man <hi>Eccle. 25. 14 <hi>The greateſt heauineſſe, is the heauineſſe of the heart. Giue me any plague ſaue the plague of the heart.</hi>
                        </hi> For griefe and ſorrow, and taking thought, doth make them pine away which be yong, luſtie and ſtrong, and by the courſe of nature are like to liue many yeares. The reaſon is, becauſe that the heart thereby doth diminiſh, and weare away by little and little, vntill the vitall ſpirits be ſpent, which haue all their comfort and ſtrength from the heart. Your hearts which haue béene caſt downe with ſorrow, ſhalbe raiſed vp againe with ioy, euen at the ſight of my
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:7821:287"/>
preſence. In the ſadde and ſorrowfull winter, all thinges decay and come to nothing, but when the ioyfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the ſunne at the ſpring time appeareth, then eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that lay dead and buried, péereth out of the ground and taketh heart, and groweth to ſtrength, and commeth to perfection: So in the ſorrowfull dayes of this worlde, the godly are abaſed, but in the ioyful time of deliuerance, when Chriſt their onely comforter ſhall appeare in glory, then ſhall their dead heartes receiue life, and comfort and ioy. In reſpect whereof, Chriſt comforted his diſciples ſaying; Let not your heart be troubled. Confirming them by thrée reaſons. The firſt from his loue, and the certaintie of his promiſes. Ye beléeue in God, beléeue alſo in me; which am readie not onely to promiſe, but alſo to performe what euer ſhall bee for your good. In the worlde yee ſhall haue trouble and affliction, in mée ye ſhall haue peace, be of good comfort, and let not your heart be diſmaied, I haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is drawen from the friendly care, that hée had to prouide for his Diſciples and for all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In my fathers houſe are manie dwellinges places, and I goe to prepare a place for you, euen for euerie one of you. And if it had not béen ſo, yée ſhoulde haue knowne it long ere this. The third reaſon ſéemeth moſt forcible, becauſe of the perfourmaunce, and preſent, and full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his promiſes. When I haue prepared, then will I come againe and eſtabliſhe euerie one of you in his euerlaſting habitation, and receiue you vnto my ſelfe, that where I am, there may ye be alſo. All which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſet downe in the fourtéenth chapter of Saint Iohn and the thrée firſt verſes. What can keepe the heart more from comforte and reioyſing, then a troubled minde, and an vnquiet conſcience? the which among all the miſeries and afflictions of this worlde the godly are frée from. Which comfort of heart, Chriſt perfourmeth vnto them. <hi>Iohn 14. 27. <hi>Peace I leaue with you, my
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:7821:288"/>
peace I giue vnto you, not as the worlde giueth, giue I vnto you. Therfore let not your heart be troubled nor feare.</hi>
                        </hi> The worlde can giue but outward comforts, if it ſhewe neuer ſo much fauour, but as for the inward comfort of the minde and conſcience, it cannot reach thereinto, it is paſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer thereof, and muſt let that alone to the working of an other. And if it were not for the heauenly comfort, the heart of the godly would ſoone fall away. And vnleſſe our Sauior Chriſt had perceiued ſuch weakneſſe, and ſuch doubtfulneſſe in the féeble and vnconſtant nature of man, hee would not haue vttered theſe words to make their comfort ſtedfaſt and ſure in him. <hi>Ye haue heard</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how I ſaid vnto you, I goe away and will come vnto you. If ye loued me ye would verily teioyce, becauſe I ſaid I goe vnto the father, for my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater then I.</hi> As if hee had ſaide, If ye loued mee throughly, and my loue were ſtedfaſt in you, your hearts would reioyce, and no troubles ſhould mooue you, and no diſcomfortes ſhould perſwade you to the contrary. This haue I ſpoken vnto you before it come, that when it is come to paſſe, ye might beléeue, and your hearts then might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with ioy. For ſurely thoſe things which I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, ſhall come to paſſe, and therefore doubt nothing, and let your hearts be confirmed and ſetled in ioy. Ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I will ſend the comforter vnto you, my holy ſpirit, the comforter of the elect and choſen, which ſhall not ſuffer your hearts to faile, but ſtil ſhal raiſe them vp in comfort in their greateſt griefes and ſorrowes. What cauſe therefore haue the godly, ſéeing theſe great comforts, as mightie proppes may ſtaie them from falling, though in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of the world there be great cauſe of ſorrow, but ſéeing they are we aned from the world, and are not of the world, what cauſe haue they I ſay, to caſt downe their hearts with ſorrow and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ueneſſe? Wherefore let the counſell of the wiſe man take place with them; <hi>Giue not ouer thy minde to heanineſſe. The ioy of the heart is the life of man, and a mans gladneſſe is the prolonging of his daies. Griefe and ſorrow ſhorten the
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:7821:288"/>
time, and bring age before the time.</hi> Wherefore comfort thy heart, and driue ſorrow farre from thée. For ſorrow hath ſlaine many, and there is no profit therin. Sorrow did ſlaie the hearts of the Canaanites, becauſe God had weakened their hearts. According to the confeſſion of <hi>Rahab,</hi> of whom we reade, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 2. when ſhe talked with the ſpies; <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>that the Lord hath giuen you the land, and that the feare of you is fallen vpon vs, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint becauſe of you. And when we heard of you, our hearts did faint, and there remained no more courage in any of vs all.</hi> This is one of Gods great puniſhments, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them that do not liue in his feare and obedience, that he wil giue them a trembling heart, and a ſorrowful mind,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Le.</hi> 26. 36.</note> to throw them out of their poſſeſſions, and to make them haue no ioy of their goods. Which we may partly ſee in the example of churliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> denying to giue comfort to them that were greatly diſtreſſed. Who when his wife had told him what heauie things were toward him, his hart died within him, and he was like a ſtone. <hi>For the Lord ſmote <hi>Nabal</hi> with that ſorrowe that hee died. <hi>Samu.</hi>
                        </hi> 25. 38.</p>
                     <p>But ſéeing in all wel-doing. God doeth comfort our hearts, why ſhould we be enemies to our ſelues, and to our owne welfare. With the Apoſtles impriſoned let vs ſing Pſalmes, to teſtifie the ioy of our hart to Godward. Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto our ſelues in Pſalmes and himnes, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſonges, ſinging and making melodie to the Lord in our hearts. And ſéeing all our hope is, or ought to bee in God, who is our only treaſure, why ſhould not our hearts be there alſo? Saying with the bleſſed virgine, <hi>My ſoule doth magnify the Lord, and my ſpirit hath reioyced in God, my Sauiour.</hi> Who although he be abſent from vs, yet hath he promiſed to come againe and to ſée vs, and to comfort our hearts and to make them reioyce. So that when your redemption ſhall drawe nigh, then lift vp your heads, and when your ioy ſhall approach, let your hearts alſo be lifted

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſorrow of the wicked and the ioy of the Godly.

                     <p>As for all worldly ioy, which doth not agrée with God and godlineſſe, let vs vtterly abandon it, and baniſh it farre from vs, neither let our hearts in any ſort delight therein.

Wherefore if thou mightſt be ſet vpon the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, there to beholde the ioy of earthly maieſtie, if thou mightſt be poſſeſſed and inthroned in the glory thereof, yet farre is it, that thy heart ſhould be ſetled in any certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Take hold of that comfort and ioy, which Chriſt thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and redéemer hath promiſed, which though thou canſt not ſée as yet, in due time thou ſhalt be partaker therof.

For worldly ioyes are often taken away, and haue diuers ellip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, alterations, and chaunges.

with great comfort and gladneſſe of heart; Who ſhall ſeperate vs from the loue of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or perill, or ſword? As it is written; For thy ſake are we killed all day long, we are counted as ſhéepe for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Neuertheleſſe in all theſe things wee are more then conquerours, through him that loued vs. Wherefore I am now perſwaded and fully reſolued, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principallities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heigth, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeperate me from the loue of GOD, which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</p>

That the triall of our faith béeing much more precious then golde that periſheth, (though it bee tried with fire) might bee founde vnto our praiſe, and honour, and glorie, at the appearing of Ieſus Chriſt.
